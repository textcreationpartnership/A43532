            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p n="1">Paragr. 1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>OOKS are ſown ſo thick in all Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi>that a new one, which one adds more to the former Groſs, had need of an Apology. The eaſie Diſpatch of ſo many Sheets in a day, by the readineſs of Printing, hath found the World a great deal more Work then needs. Many that love Knowledge, both Induſtrious, and of ſound Judgment, are not nice to ſay, that Repletion of Authors hath begat Loathing. Which is a Reaſon likewiſe, or a Pretence, that divers, who are Learned and full Men, contain their Liquor in their Veſſels, and never broach it in the Preſs to make it Publick, becauſe they think it is Folly to contribute to Waſte and Exceſs. I am one of thoſe, I confeſs, that wiſh it were poſſible, that a <hi>Moſes</hi> could be raiſed up to reſtrain us, from bringing more either of our Pamphlets, or Volumes, to the Work of the Tabernacle; <hi>For the Stuff already is ſufficient for all the Work to make it, and too much,</hi> Exod. 36.7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How ſhall I anſwer it therefore? Or, how ſhall I defend that I am conſtant to mine own Judgment in this Deſign, that I thruſt my Labours into the World? What Warrant can I plead, that I build a new Cottage upon the Waſte? I conceive that it will ſtand for ſatisfaction, that I ſet forth an Hiſtory of Things not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd before, but of memorable Paſſages running through the Channel of one Man's Life in our preſent Age. It is a Debt owed to Poſterity, to furniſh them with the true Knowledge of ſore-gone Occurrences, worthy to be Regiſtred; as, I believe, theſe enſuing are. A Tradition muſt be kept of famous Exploits, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially moving upon the Stage of turbulent Times. For when it is skilfully drawn through the Acts of famous Men, it will rouze up our Children by Emulation as much as by Precept, and give them double advantage to ſeek Virtue and Glory. But better it will be to have it coarſe ſpun, then quite omitted: For ſuch will ſerve for Cork, to keep a Net from ſinking.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Century of our Account from Chriſt's Birth wherein we live, now waſting beyond the middle, hath been happy in this, That it hath brought forth in our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England</hi> many of great Renown, Wiſe and Eloquent, deep in Learning, and ſage in Counſels, in a word, to be praiſed as much as the beſt of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers; yet granting to all, both former and latter, an Allowance for ſome Grains of Frailties. It were pity their Memorial ſhould periſh with them. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was a large ſeeker of Glory; yet grudge no Man a ſhare in Glory, as teſtifies that little which remains of his Oration for the <hi>Bithynians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>It is a Duty required from the ſurviving Generation, to keep them alive in their good Name, who deſerv'd it, and can endure the Cenſure of the World for ever.</hi> I liſten to his Encouragement; yet meaſuring my Strength by mine own Meet-wand, I task my ſelf to ſet up a Pillar but for one Man's Memory. The Event will clear me, that I ſtint not my ſelf to this one Theme to do but little.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there is ſo much Kernel in one Shell; I muſt ſet forth a great Biſhop, a great Judge, a great Counſellor, in all theſe Capacities moſt active
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49492:3"/>in moſt active Times. Such a Mill will not go with a little Water. Beſide the Turnings and Returnings of his Fortune, multiformous Changeableneſs, rather Prodigious then Strange, <hi>by Honour and Diſhonour, by Evil Report and good Report,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.8. Which will draw conſiderate Thoughts for no little time to this one Center. As <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Life, interwoven with much Glory,
<note place="margin">Lib. 7. Nat. Hiſt. c. 45.</note> and much Misfortune, <hi>Si diligenter aeſtimentur ſancta, magna ſortis humanae reperiantur volumina.</hi> So it is highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that in this one Piece a diligent Eye may diſcern all the Colours of human Inconſtancy and Inſtability.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſpend all my little Skill upon this Subject; for I can draw no Picture ſo like, becauſe I knew none ſo well. I noted his Ways and Worth in the Univerſity, when I was but young. I obſerv'd him in his earlieſt Preferments, when he came firſt ſledge out of the Neſt. I was taken into his Houſhold Service, as ſoon as he aſcended to his higheſt Office. And commencing from that time till thirty Years expired with his Life, I treſpaſs not againſt Modeſly if I ſay, I knew his Courſes as much, and ſaw them at as near a diſtance, as any Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. I have as much Intelligence from an Eye-witneſs Information, and from his familiar Conference with me, as can be expected from any Writer of the Memorials of a great Statiſt: <hi>Qui audiunt audita dicunt, qui vident planè ſciunt,</hi> ſays <hi>Plautus</hi>very well. He that reports but what he hears, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he is at uncertainty; he that ſees a Thing done, can relate it perfectly. <hi>Pliny</hi> hath caſt down a great deal of that which he built up in the ſeventh Book of his <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> with this Paſſage in his Proem, <hi>Nec in pleríſque corum obſtringam ſidem meam, potiúſque ad autores relegabo.</hi> He would make Faith for little of that which he wrote; but turns his Reader over to ſuch Authors, as himſelf did not truſt in. I am far from ſuch Prevarication. I drew the knowledge of thoſe things of moſt moment which I ſhall deliver from the Spring-Head. And I truſt in God, that I have incorporated them into this Frame with Integrity. This then is my confidence to make this Compilement, that my Tools were whetted at home. I need not repair to the <hi>Allophyli,</hi> or <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> to ſharpen my Axe at their Grind-ſtone.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I am full of willingneſs to be the Father of this Child: And nothing is apter for a Man to undergo, then that which is agreeable to his Delight. I profeſs it is not the leaſt of my drifts to ſweeten my Maſter's Memory with a ſtrong compoſed Perfume; and to carve him out in a commendable, but a true Figure. Suffer me to put one Day to his Life after his Deceaſe. When a worthy Man's Fame ſurvives him, through their help, that light a Candle for that uſe, that others in ſucceſſion of Ages may perfectly behold him, it is a grateful Service to put one Day more, as it were, to the Life of Nature, but a Day that may be longer, perhaps, then the Mortal preceding Life thrice told over. The Learned <hi>Grotius</hi> (Who can ſtop his Conjectures?) thinks it not improbable, but that the Sun went down, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.13. when <hi>Joſhua</hi> purſued the Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Ajalon: Sed poſt Solis occaſum ſpeciem ejus in nube ſupra horizontem extanti per repercuſſum oſtendere:</hi> That is, a kind of Sun, that made a great Luſtre, ſhined ſufficiently to make it Day, not in his Preſence, but in the repercuſſion of his Beams upon a Cloud. I cite it only for Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; that when a renowned Man is departed, his laſt Sun ſet, the worthy Deeds of his Life may yet ſhine in our Horizon, as it were by Repercuſſion in the memory of after-times; which cauſeth a longer Day then any, nay then all that went before.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now I fear I am in danger of a ſtabbing Cenſure, through the Diſcovery of ſome part of my Aim in this laſt Confeſſion: For I have divulg'd, that I offer up this Book as a Banner at the Shrine of this Renowned Prelate's Memory. Some will ſay, What could be utter'd more in way of Prejudice, to entangle the Belief of the Reader with Knots of Jealouſie? A Maſter in this Art,<hi>Dionyſius
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49492:3"/>Halicarnaſſus</hi> gives this for one Rule, to examine prudentially the Truth of an Hiſtory, by conſidering, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Affection of the Writer. For my part, I deſire to be tried by ſuch a conſiderate Overſeer. And let him judge uprightly, that I could not but underſtand, it had been better for me to have ſmother'd my Purpoſe, which I hold out before the open Light, if I had meant corruptly, and would ſtain my Paper, and my Conſcience, with blots of Falſhood and Flattery. I fear God. And he that feels that Motion within him, will not ſeek Honour to himſelf, much leſs to caſt it upon another, by Conſenage and Fictions. Or if Religion, careleſly preſent, did not bind ſo hard, I think Diſcretion and Experience ſhould advertiſe any Man, that he is a Fool that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins he can poiſon the whole World with a Lye. <hi>Polybius</hi> ſpeaks ſoundly, that Truth will be obſcur'd by no Hiſtory, by no Conſpiracy.

                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Aber. Conway</hi> in the County of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> was the Son of <hi>William Williams</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Coghwillanne</hi> near adjoyning, and of <hi>Dorothy</hi> Daughter to Sir <hi>William Griffith</hi> Knight, of <hi>Penrhyn.</hi> This <hi>Edmond</hi> took to Wife <hi>Mary</hi> Daughter to <hi>Owen Wyn</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and by her had five Sons and two Daughters. Of the Male Children, <hi>John</hi> was the youngeſt; the Womb of his Mother ceaſing to bear, when it had done its beſt. This <hi>John,</hi> whoſe Memory deſerves to be Dignified in a laſting Story, was born at <hi>Aber-Conway,</hi> a Sea-Town in <hi>Carnarvanſhire,</hi> about, or upon the Feaſt-day of our Lady the Bleſſed Virgin, <hi>March</hi> 25. 1582. The Shire wherein he drew his firſt Breath, is notorious for the higheſt Hills of this Iſland, <hi>Snoden, Penmanmaur, Creig-Eriri,</hi> and others. It is not unlikely that it hath much Riches under the Earth, but it is Barren above Ground. As <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Orobii,</hi> certain Mountainers in <hi>Italy,</hi> Lib. 3. c. 17. <hi>Etiam nomine prodentes ſe al. tius quàm fortunatiùs ſitos:</hi> Their Situation was rather high than proſperous. But what the Region wants in Fatneſs of Soil, is requited by the Generous Spirits of the Inhabitants, a far greater Honour than much Clay and Dirt. I light upon it in the Invention of a Maſque, Preſented before King <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Whitehall, An.</hi> 1619. that our Laureat-Poet <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi> hath let ſome weighty Words drop from him, to the Honour of that Nation, and I take them as a ſerious Paſſage, and will own them, That the Country is a Seed-Plot of honeſt Minds and Men. What Lights of Learning hath <hi>Wales</hi> ſent forth for our Schools? What Induſtrious Students of our Laws? What Able Miniſters of Juſtice? Whence hath the Crown in all times better Servitors, more Liberal of their Lives and Fortunes? And I know I have their good Leave to ſay, That the Honour of <hi>Wales</hi> ſhin'd forth abroad in the Luſtre of ſuch a Native as this; and I add what <hi>Pliny</hi> writes to <hi>Sabinus</hi> of the <hi>Firmians,</hi> among whom he was born, <hi>Credibile eſt optimos eſſe inter quos tu talis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titeris,</hi> Lib. 6. Epiſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For <hi>Carnarvanſhire</hi> in particular, ſays Reverend Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> the Ordovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lived there of old, who held the <hi>Romans</hi> Play to preſerve their Liberties the longeſt of all our <hi>Britains:</hi> and forced the <hi>Roman</hi> General <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> to fix
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49492:5"/>his Head-Quarter there, deſiring to keep them his firſt and ſureſt Friends, who were his laſt ſubdued Enemies. Afterward the <hi>Saxons</hi> had the longeſt and ſtouteſt Repulſes in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> that they felt in all their Battels; which made them bloody their Swords moſt barbarouſly in the Bodies of thoſe reſolute Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Among the Champions of greateſt Note and Valour, that did the beſt Feats of Chivalry againſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> was a gallant Commander, the Top of the Houſe of <hi>Williams,</hi> which is preſerv'd in Memory to this day, becauſe the Family of that Name doth until this time bear in their Coat three <hi>Saxons</hi> Heads, (<hi>De tree pen Saix,</hi> they call it in <hi>Welch,</hi> I think) a noble Teſtimony of the Valour of the Chief of that Stock, that ſought manfully for his Country, and preſerv'd it from the Invaſion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when their Armies had march'd over the Ground of <hi>England</hi> (now ſo called) with Slaughter and Conqueſts. And ſince the beſt Men of the ancient Houſes in <hi>Wales</hi> did manage War ſo valiantly in maintenance of Glory and Liberty, it is no marvel if the Inhabitants are noted in the current Ages ever ſince, to have almoſt a Religious Care in preſerving the Pedigrees of their Gentry. Who could excuſe them from Ingratitude, if they ſhould not garniſh Heraldry with the Genealogies of ſuch Worthies?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Among their copious Stems, and far-fetch'd Deſcents, the Pedigree of the Houſe of <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Coghwillanne</hi> hath as many brave Strings in the Root, and ſpreads as wide in the Branches, as I have ſeen produced from the Store-houſe of their <hi>Cambrian</hi> Antiquities. It grows up in the top Boughs to the Princes of <hi>North-Wales</hi> in King <hi>Stephen</hi>'s days, as it is deducted by Authentick Records which I have ſeen, and are formalized into a comely ſhape by <hi>Evan Lloyd</hi> of <hi>Egloyvach</hi> in the County of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Chaloner</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Gent. Men faithful and expert in ſuch Monuments of elder Years. The ſame Authors demonſtrate, that <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Coghwillanne</hi> hath continued his Coat of three <hi>Saxons</hi> Heads con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and without any the léaſt alteration, from <hi>Edneuet Vychan</hi> Lord-Steward of <hi>Wales, an.</hi> 1240. and of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. his Reign, <hi>an.</hi> 25. to this day. It hit right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for a Coat of Arms, ſays the neat Wit of Mr. <hi>Hugh Hotland,</hi> when one of that Lineage was advanced to be Lord-Keeper of the Great-Seal, as he couched it in an elegant Diſtic, engraven on his Lordſhip's Silver Standiſh, as I found it there:
<q xml:lang="lat">

                        </l>
                     </q> Meaning, it was a ſign he had the Abilities and Brains of three Heads, whoſe good Parts lifted him up to that Honour, to ſet Chief Judge in the higheſt Court of the Kingdom. But I need neither the light Air of Poetry, much leſs the empty Wind of Vain-boaſting, to blow it about the World, that he was Anciently and Nobly deſcended, there are ſo many Proofs for it, as there are Offsprings of Gentry in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> being all of his Blood and Alliance, to whom a Catalogue might be added of Great and Honourable Perſons in <hi>England.</hi> Which King <hi>James</hi> was aware of, when he was ſworn his Counſellor; for He told him pleaſantly, that He thought not the worſe of him, nor ſuſpected his Fidelity, though He knew well enough, that Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> (then living) a great Traitor to his Prince and Country, was his near Kinſman. I could inſiſt more upon this; but it is the Rule of a wiſe Author, that whoſoever will ſearch into a Man prudently and Philoſophically,
<q xml:lang="lat">
                        <hi>—Nunquam cunabula quaerit:—Et qualis, non unde ſatus.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cloſe it up therefore, that his Pedigree of Anceſtors gave a good Luſtre to his Birth, but he gave a greater to them. Howſoever I receive it for a Moral Truth, as well as a Mathematical, that the longeſt Line is the leaſt of all quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titive Dimenſions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now to begin with my Subject, from the firſt time that he was able to go without the hand. His Education was like to be Proſperous, for not only his Parents, but his Grandmother the Lady <hi>Griffith;</hi> his Grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> as well as his Mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> contributed her Care to give him Godly and Learned Breeding. It fell out well for their purpoſe, that their Pious Country-man <hi>Gabriel Goodman,</hi> Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> had about that time founded a Publick School at <hi>Reuthen,</hi> and had placed a good Grammarian in it, under whom he was taught his firſt Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues. I have heard ſome of his Contemporaries
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49492:5"/>ſay, that his Maſter knew not for a while how to manage him, he was of ſo ſtrange a mixture; for at ſometimes he was addicted to loiter and play, and to much exerciſe of Body: Again, by fits he would ply his Book ſo induſtriouſly, that his <hi>Praeceptor</hi> thought it a great deal too much for a Child to undergo it. But, like a prudent Man, he quickly conſented to leave his Scholar to his own pace; wherein he got ground ſo faſt of all his Fellows. He that raiſed himſelf up to that height of Knowledge in his adult Age, had need to lay ſome part of the Foundation ſo early: For as <hi>Comines</hi> obſerves it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Hiſt. Indubitatum eſt ees qui in ullâ re unquam excelluerunt, maturi puerilibus annis ad cam acceſſiſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. All things fell out happily by Divine Diſpoſition, to bring him up from a towardly Youth, to a worthy Man. For by that time this Bud began to blow, it fortun'd that Dr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> afterward the Reverend Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> came into <hi>Wales,</hi> and took the School of <hi>Reuthen</hi> in his way, where he found his young Kinſman <hi>John Williams</hi> to be the Bell-weather of the little Flock. Dr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> was exceeding glad to find him in that forwardneſs, and being not only as Learned as moſt Men to try a Scholar, but Judicious above moſt Men to conjecture at a rich Harveſt by the green Blade in the Spring, took ſpeedy care to remove his Kinſman to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and commended him to the Tuition of Mr. <hi>Owen Gum</hi> of St. <hi>John</hi>'s College, well qualified by his Country and Alliance for a Friend, and no indiligent Tutor. The young Youth was now entring into the 16th Year of his Age, <hi>an.</hi> 1598. much welcom'd to <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the Old <hi>Britains</hi> of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> who praiſed him mightily in all places of the Univerſity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>for they are good at that, to them of their own Lineage,) and made more Eyes be caſt upon him, than are uſual upon ſuch a Punie. Which took the rather, becauſe of his great Comelineſs, I might ſay Beauty: And it is a great Attractive of common Favour, when virtue takes up a fair Lodging. One thing put him to the bluſh, and a little Shame, that ſuch as had gigling Spleens would laugh at him for his <hi>Welſh</hi> Tone. For thoſe who knew him at his Admiſſion into St. <hi>John</hi>'s Society, would often ſay, that he brought more <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> than good <hi>Engliſh</hi> with him. This alſo pluck'd Advantage after it; for it made him a very retired Student, by ſhunning Company and Conference, as far as he could, till he had loſt the Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Native Dialect. Which he labour'd and affected, becauſe he gave his Mind to be an Orator; which requires, <hi>Decus linguae, regnumque loquendi,</hi> as <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> lays it out, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. And all that heard him will ſubſcribe, that when he was put to it to ſpeak publickly, his Geſture and Pronunciation did add much Grace to his Matter, and Invention.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He was the Pattern of a moſt diligent Student to all that did emulate him then, or would imitate him hereafter. He had read over ſo many Authors in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sciences, ſo many Volumes, ſo many Hiſtorians and Poets, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> in four Years, (the Evidence of it was in his Note-Books) that I may ſay, <hi>Aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ultra putes;</hi> who would have thought it had been the diſpatch of an Under-Graduate? He had ranſack'd not only the bare Courts, and ſpacious Lodgings, but the very Cloſets and Corners of the beſt Arts and Authors. Nothing ſo great that exceeded him; nothing ſo little that eſcap'd him. I will make this Credible to all that are not utter Drones. He plied his Book, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; As much in the Night, as in the Day. Nature contributed to this a ſtrange Aſſiſtance, that from his Youth to his old Age he ask'd but 3 hours Sleep in 24, to keep him in good plight of Health. This we all knew, who lived in his Family. It would not quickly be believed, but that a cloud of Witneſſes will avouch it, that it was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary with him to begin his Studies at ſix of the clock, and continue them till three in the morning, and be ready again by ſeven to walk in the Circle of his indefatigable Labours. <hi>Ariſto</hi> complains thus in <hi>Pliny,</hi> l. 7. c. 50. <hi>Vivendi breve tempus homini datum, quoniam ſomnus veluti publicanus dimidium aufert.</hi> That which makes the Life of Man ſhort is, That Sleep, like an exacting Publican, takes half of it away for Toll and Tribute. But here was one that paid very little Cuſtom to that common Publican of Nature, and kept ſo much Time continually going in his Stock, that he lived almoſt twice as much as any Man, that lived no longer. Who will not ſay now, but ſo much Toil was plain Drudgery? And I marvel it the more, that ſo great a Wit could endure to task him to ſuch conſtant and vexatious Pains. No doubt he look'd far afore him, upon the hope of a great Recompence in Church or Commonwealth: that contented him, and confirmed him. <hi>Marius</hi> ſpeaks gailantly in <hi>Saluſt, Nae illi falſi ſunt qui res diverſiſſimas pariter expectant, ignaviae voluptatem, &amp; praemia virtutis.</hi> They are much miſtaken, that think to piece together two Things ſo different, the Pleaſure of Eaſe, and the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49492:6"/>Guerdon of Virtue. Therefore all theſe concurr'd together in him to make up the Maſter-piece of a Scholar, a rare Wit, a moſt tenacious and even ſtupendious Memory, a clear Judgment, a moſt diſtinguiſhing common Senſe, called <hi>Natural Logick,</hi> which is the beſt, and moſt vital part of Judgment, and that which hatch'd all theſe, that they might not addle, unceſſant Induſtry. Truly he that will build many Stories high, had need of all theſe Materials. And let thoſe that are happy in great Natural Endowments take Example by him, to joyn the Felicity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with ſuch a Mate as Diligence. Gardners give the moſt attendance to the beſt Stocks in their Nurſery, and the Fruit will quit the Coſt, after due time hath matur'd it. It was God above therefore that gave his young Servant ſo wiſe a Mind, to fill up the choice Veſſels of Nature with Liquors diſtill'd from his own Studies. And herein I may compare him to <hi>Meſſala Corvinus</hi> in <hi>Tully,</hi> as he writes of him to <hi>Brutus,</hi> Ep. 15. <hi>Tanta induſtria eſt, tantúmque evigilat in ſtudio, ut non maximo ingenio (quod in e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="8">8. I have not added a Grain to the juſt weight of Truth, that his Sails were filled with proſperous Winds, which blew from the Cape of Nature, yet that he plied the Oar with main might to make a gaining Voyage. Eſpecially the good God was pleaſed to give a good Rudder to the Veſſel to ſtear it right, both in the Channel of true Religion, and virtuous Practice. For in thoſe Lubric and often failing years, he neither fell upon the Rocks of dangerous Errors in Opinion, nor ſtuck in the quick Sands of Vice. He was duly preſent at the Service of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer in the College-Chappel: And in his private Prayers, as he began, ſo he did ever continue to commend himſelf to God's Mercy and Protection mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, rather with a due Conſtancy, and, as it were, Canonical, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be diſpens'd with, then a long winded Prolixity; it grew up with him by a Catechetical Principle, rather to be, then after a contrivance and faſhion, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be a good Chriſtian. I expound him thus: A Face ſet ſmooth by the Glaſs of Hypocriſie, an affected ſhew of holy Simplicity, a dreaming ſimpering of Words to ſhuffle into the good Opinion of the World by mere Hiſtrionical Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he declined in himſelf, and diſlik'd in others. Though he did not ſtrive to cry up himſelf for a great-gifted Saint, yet no wholſom Morals, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in ſuch green and ſappy Years, were wanting in him. He was obedient to Superiors, ſtrictly juſt in his Word, and in all Commerce and Dealing a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friend, and, as will appear more in the Sequel, no Vindicative Enemy. He was no Loiterer, no Companion for Ruffians and looſe Perſons, no Tippler, no Wine-bibber. And though the Univerſity Diſcipline began to be more remiſs in thoſe days, then in by-gone Ages, yet he conſin'd himſelf moſt inculpably to Modeſty and Sobriety, not ſo much as leaning towards Youthful Exorbitancies. So far he was a Stranger to wanton Luſts, that his Acquaintance marvelled, that the more the Sin came near to him, ſo comely a Feature wanting not Enticement, the further he ran from it. <hi>Arthur Wilſon,</hi> in his Hiſtory of King <hi>James,</hi> by ſome ſecret Whiſper came nigh to the Diſcovery of the Reaſon. Not that he was an Eunuch <hi>ab utero,</hi> as he bluntly delivers it; but he had ſuffer'd an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Miſchance, being about 7 Years old, which compell'd him to actual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. He took a leap, being then in long Coats, from the Walls of <hi>Conway</hi> Town to the Sea-ſhore, looking that the Wind, which was then very ſtrong, would fill his Coats like a Sail, and bear him up, as it did with his Play-fellows: But he found it otherwiſe, for he did light with his Belly upon a big ragged Stone, which cauſed a ſecret Infirmity, fitter to be underſtood, then further deſcrib'd; and want of timely Remedy, the Skill of good Chirurgery being little known in that Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, continued it to his dying day. They that traduc'd him when he came to be Lord-Keeper, not only to be Amorous, but to be Incontinent with a great Lady, and taught common Fidlers to ſing it, may bluſh at this Diſcovery, if they be alive; but if they died without Repentance, it may be they want the tip of his Finger dipp'd in Water to cool their Tongues.</p>

Though I have not concealed that he was Chaſt perforce, yet I muſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him, that in the uſe of Meats and Drinks he was one of the moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men in the Kingdom of free Election. I think he ſuck'd it in with his Milk, it was ſo fix'd in him. To let paſs how well he was ſatisfied with his ſhort Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Fare, I will go further, and come to him, when he came to be a great Houſe-keeper. He kept a full Table, elegantly ſet forth, none of his Rank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him. Yet I ſcarce ever ſaw him eat a plentiful Meal. He ſupplied the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49492:6"/>convival time at his Board with Carving and Diſcourſe, which made his Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence leſs obſerv'd by his Gueſts; but it was moſt beneficial to him. He that eats ſparingly, ſacrificeth to Health, and is fit for Labour, and Watchfulneſs upon all Occaſions. What Repugnancy there was in his Concoction to Fleſh, I know not; but he fed the leaſt upon it that ever I ſaw: His Diet upon his own Trencher conſiſting chiefly out of a Dairy, a Garden, and an Orchard. No Capuchin kept <hi>Lent,</hi> and Fiſh-days, as we term them, more ſtrictly. As his Appetite was eaſily under his Will, ſo his Will was as much under the Laws of the Realm. It were a raſh Cenſure to count him Superſtitious in this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Abſtinence, becauſe he would not be a Libertine. Obedience is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſmalleſt Commandments, and which are cuſtomarily broken.

His Father was a Gentleman of a bountiful and kind Heart, and ſpent more upon himſelf, and upon his Neighbours, then upon his Children. But the numerous Stock of rich Gentry, to which he was Allied, his dear Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother eſpecially, made him a great Allowance. But to ſay the truth, all of them could never fill his Purſe. From a Youth, and ſo upward, he had not a Fiſt to hold Money, for he did not only lay out, but ſcatter, ſpending all that he had, and ſomewhat for which he could be truſted. By one Inſtance, which I have heard much quoted in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he did diſcover a moſt charitable and franc Affection. That unparallell'd worthy Man Mr. <hi>Edward Liveley,</hi> Publick-Profeſſor of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, was ſo unprovided to ſuſtain himſelf and his Family, that he was put to a ſad ſhift, to ſell a part of his Library, which being made known to ſome by pitiful Rumour, and to young <hi>Williams,</hi> among others in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he got the Sum of three Pounds together, and carried it home to Mr. <hi>Liveley,</hi> which the Learned Man's Neceſſity made him accept, and his Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs told it abroad, to bring his pretty benefactor into Eſtimation, which was much noiſed, that ſo little a Hand did open it ſelf, when large ones were ſhut. Many things concur'd to make him talk'd of, and to be noted out for future Eminency; yet Envy, that loves to crop the Bud of Virtue, had two Things to object againſt him. Firſt, That he gave Diſtaſt to ſome by his Vehemency of Anger, not ſeldom flying out. 'Tis true, he was obnoxious to <hi>Arles</hi>

But as <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the chiefeſt of the <hi>Aeſculapians,</hi> writes, <hi>Where Fire abounds in the Mixture, and exceeds the Moiſture, ſuch Flaſhes cannot always be ſuppreſs'd.</hi> And ſublime Wits are ſeldom without the Frailty to bring them to Humility.

They were of the old Stock of <hi>Non-conformitants,</hi> and among the Seniors of his College, who look'd four upon him, becauſe he was an Adherent to, and a Stickler for the Diſcipline and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> theſe laid their Heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to exclude him from Preferment, but their Plot would not hit. Others that were the moſt orderly Sons of the Church, were not pleaſed with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he frequented Reverend Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Congregation. It is true, he was his conſtant Auditor, while Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> lived, ſo early his well-kneaded Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment took delight in clear and ſolid Divinity.

And to make that Degree ſit upon him with the better Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, within a Month he was made Fellow of his College, with the advantage of that Seniority which promiſed him the Proctorſhip of the Univerſity, if he lived to it, according to the conſtant Order of that Society. <hi>Filii prunae exultant vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare,</hi> Job 5.7. He was full of warmth, and tended upward.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49492:7"/>upon him. He was no heavy Log to be lifted up to a Fellowſhip with a Court-Leaver. But the Place being extraordinary, (for it was pregnant with the Pretor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) there needed ſome Engine from above to ſettle him. Without diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Merit, it ſhall not be concealed, that ſome of the Seniors did make reſiſtance againſt him, whoſe Suffrages are requiſite by Statute for the Election of Fellows. One or two of them were obſerved to ſtop the Advancement of all the moſt ſharp Wits, as far as they could, Men not to be compared with the ſweet Philoſopher <hi>Plato,</hi> but like him in this, That <hi>Plato</hi> would not admit <hi>Homer</hi> into his Commonwealth, for he was too great a Citizen for his City. This was a Grief apparent, that Mr. <hi>Aluy,</hi> though himſelf departed into <hi>Ireland,</hi> had left of his Spirit among them, a Spirit devious from the Quiet and Happy Way of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Church Diſcipline. And this did ſeaſon a few with a wrong Zeal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch whoſe Learning and prudent Behaviour did promiſe, that they would be Champions for Conformity. But he that was then the Pinacle of the Codege, far higher then the low-rooſt Building of the reſt, was Dr. <hi>Playſere,</hi> one of the Public Profeſſors of Divinity, and of moſt celebrated Eloquence, (let me carve a good Figure for his Memory in this Structure,) it was he that opened the ſtiff Soil, and planted this young Sprig in his Fellowſhip, and led him in his hand out of the Throng of Contradiction. You may gueſs, that the young Batchelor did Glory in it, and had the ſenſe of <hi>Juily</hi> in his mind, when he ſaid, <hi>He had rather be Praiſed by</hi> Cato, <hi>then have a Triumph voted to him by the Senate.</hi>

It was his common Theme, even when he was a Biſhop, if young Students were at his Table, to inveigh gravely againſt Batchelors of Arts, becauſe commonly they mis-ſpent that Triennial Probation, and left upon that place a <hi>Vacuum</hi> of doing little or nothing. He that leaſt of all committed that Crime, might beſt ſet Judge upon the Guilty. For his own part, now his Clay was upon that Wheel, it turn d about, as Peripateties ſay of the higheſt Sphere, with a moſt rapid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He ſurrendred up his whole Time to dive into the Immenſe Well of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that hath no bottom. He Read the Beſt, he Heard the Beſt, he Conferr'd with the Beſt, Excrib'd, committed to Memory; Diſputed, he had ſome Work continually upon the Loom. And though he never did ſo much in this unwearied Induſtry, as himſelf deſired, he did far more then all that did highly value him could expect. <hi>Ingenium caeleſte ſuis v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Equals of the ſame time began to find his Diſcourſe far above their pitch in weighty Judgment; and what was look'd for from him in his Public Exerciſes, might be perceived by the Throng that come to Hear him, and that none at the parting but Admired him.

                  <p n="13">13. He that will dig diligently for Wiſdom, God will provide a Mine for him to Recompence his Labour; my Proof lies thus: Here was a Student that would take any pains to know much; and God ſupplied him with as good Men in that Age, as ever <hi>Cambridge</hi> afforded before or ſince, that were able to teach him. A Scholar can have no taſte of Natural Philoſophy, without ſome conditement of the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> See the good luck of it, that he had Mr. <hi>Edward Briggs</hi> within the Walls of the ſame College for his Maſter; by whom he was initiated into the Principles of <hi>Geometry,</hi> which never departed out of his tenacious Memory. Yet he did but kiſs the Cup of thoſe Sciences, and drank not deep: Fruit that is next the Sun, may change the colour; but unleſs it hang long on the Tree, it comes not to maturity. He frequented Mr. <hi>Lively</hi> and Mr. <hi>Downes,</hi> (<hi>Duo Scipiadae</hi>) the Profeſſors of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues in the Publick Schools, from whoſe full Breaſts he ſuck'd moſt excellent Skill in thoſe Learned Languages. He had alſo other choice <hi>Praeceptors</hi> to perfect him in the Sacred Tongue, Mr. <hi>Robert Spal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> a modeſt and no leſs Learned Divine, Fellow of St. <hi>John</hi>'s, and Rabbi <hi>Jacob</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> born, whom I remember for a long time a Commorant in the Univerſity; with the Inſtruction of theſe two, he dived far into the Myſtery of that Holy Language. But chiefly he did heartily acknowledge, that the Hand of God did go with him, that Dr. <hi>Overal</hi> was the King's Profeſſor in the Chair of Divinity in his Years of ſoft Wax, from whom he took ſuch a right Orthodox Impreſſion of ſtating Theological Controverſies. I ask'd him on a time, what it was that pleaſed him in Dr. <hi>Overal</hi> above all others whom he heard to handle Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Divine Points in a Scholaſtical Form? He gave me this Anſwer; becauſe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49492:7"/>Firſt, Dr. <hi>Overal</hi> was uſed to prove his Concluſion out of two or three Texts of Scripture at the moſt, and no more, being ſuch Places upon whoſe right Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation the judgment of the Cauſe did chiefly depend. Secondly, That above all Men that ever he heard, he did moſt pertinently quote the Fathers, both to the right ſenſe of their Phraſe, which few did underſtand, and out of thoſe their Treatiſes, wherein eſpecially they handled the Cauſe, for which he Appealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And, Thirdly, When he had fixed what was prime and principal Truth in any Debate, with great Meekneſs and Sweetneſs he gave copious Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to his Auditors, how far they might diſſent, keeping the Foundation ſure, without breach of Charity. Theſe were the Conſtellations, whoſe fortunate Aſpect did ſhine upon this <hi>Neophytus</hi> in the Orb of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and being under the Influence of ſuch Luminaries, a judicious Academian might Prognoſtic, how much he would proſper without a judicious Aſtrologer. But for all that he poſted ſo ſpeedily through the broad Way of the beſt Tracts of Knowledge, yet he found a little leiſure to call in as he went, at the attaining of ſome Skill in <hi>Muſick,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental and Vocal, not as a <hi>Siren</hi> to catch him, but as a Delight to ſolace him.

I am ſure I explain a Man, who added as much Grace to the Name, as any his Anceſtors; of thoſe that came after, he that was the beſt, was but ſecond in the Order. Every day (borrowing much of the Night) advanced his Knowledge. He hired himſelf to labour under all Arts, and ſorts of Learning. The more he toil'd, the more he perceiv'd, that nothing in this Earth had ſuch Amplitude, as the extent of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: He ſaw it was a Proſpect which had no Horizon, a Man can never ſay, he ſees the utmoſt Bound of the Coaſt. Therefore he was continually drawing his Bow, becauſe he was ſure he could never ſhoot home. No Man fiſhes to get all the Fiſh in the Sea; yet ſince the Sea contains ſo much, he is ſlothful that labours but for a little. Our Student began now to fall cloſe to the deep, and ſpacious Studies of Divinity. I deliver from his own mouth what he would relate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in his riper Years; That he began to read all the Scriptures with the choiceſt and moſt literal, and, as he found it fit, with the briefeſt Commentators, ſo that all his Superſtructure might knit cloſe to that Foundation. He compared the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places of <hi>P.

But an Artiſt knoweth not what he hath got by all his Diligence till he uſeth it; neither can a Scholar underſtand what Taſt is in the Waters of his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Therefore he diſcloſed himſelf both in his own Terms, and for his Friends, in common Places and in Problems, ſweet as <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Honey in the one, ſtrong as his Lion in the other. By both he received mighty Praiſe from his Elders, and great Thanks from the younger Fry, whoſe Benefit is to be intended in ſuch Exerciſes.

And that he might be to ſeek in nothing, which might exactly furniſh him in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Chriſt, he adventur'd to read the School-men, Hiſtories Eccleſiaſtical, and the Fathers all together. Conceive me that this courſe of Study begun ſo early, co-extended with all the ſpace of his Life. But was it poſſible for one Hand, and yet but a tender one, to graſp all this together?

Such a Scheme, as I have drawn forth at large of his profounder Studies, was expedient to be put whole together, to avoid the trouble of broken Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. With the weight of thoſe Plummets, his Wheels began to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout at the 25 year of his Age: And with the ſame Plummets the Clock went even Hour from Hour, from Month to Month, to the expiration of his Life. He never chang'd his faſhion. Now let me invite ſuch as may peruſe theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to go back with me, and to look upon him again in the Spring of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip of Arts. <hi>For who hath deſpiſed the day of ſmall things?</hi> as the Prophet ſays, <hi>Zachar.</hi> 4.10. And becauſe he made his firſt, and moſt advantagious Sallies into the World about this time, being employ'd for his College in Civil or Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Cauſes, call them as you will, I will bring him upon that Stage before I go further. Dr. <hi>Clayton,</hi> the Head of St. <hi>Johns</hi> College at that time, was a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and prudent Governour at home, Thrifty for the publick Stock, Meek and quiet as any of that Dignity. Yet it is not poſſible that ſo numerous a Society ſhould be ſo fortunate, to diſpatch all their buſineſs among themſelves, what by Suits of Law, which burſt in upon them by bad Tenants; what by frivolous complaints often Raiſed by their own Members, but by theſe and other ſudden Claps, againſt which there is no prevention, the Governour being very Aged, and wiſely contented to diſpatch others to ſtruggle in ſuch conteſtations, he ſent forth divers that were Truſty and Judicious to be employ'd in ſuch deſigns. But if it were a knot to be cleaved by a ſtrong Wedg, he did always entreat Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> either alone, or with collegues, to manage ſuch an Enterprize. As the Greeks Adagy goes, <hi>Nil ſine</hi> Theſeo, <hi>Theſeus</hi> made one in every Maſter-piece of Chivalry: Such was our <hi>Theſeus</hi> to the <hi>Athens</hi> where he lived. And he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately lookt upon for ſuch ſervice, for he well underſtood any thing he went about, he had a fineneſs to be Gracious with them to whom he was ſent, and no man could deliver a Tale more ſmoothly, or wrinkle it leſs with digreſſions, or Parentheſes. To ſay much in brief, he had the Policy and Gravity of a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, before he had a Hair upon his Chin. The Meſſages of greateſt Truſt committed to him from the College were to theſe Eminent perſons that follow; To the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Chancellour of the Univerſity. By the way I can Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he much lamented, that he knew that moſt Wiſe Lord <hi>Cecil</hi> no longer, or upon no greater occaſions; whom he extolled above all Wits, ſpying him through the Tryal of ſuch petty matters as were brought before his Lordſhip in his Preſence: For, as if the Chancellour had a Spirit of Divination, he would inſtantly diſcover, whether the Suit made to him were fit for his ſerious care, or whether it were but Faction and Envy, the Diſeaſes of Scholars within their own Walls, that made a Clamour for Juſtice. Upon ſuch like Errands for his Society, he was admitted ſometimes to Speak and Argue before the true Pillar of the Church, Arch-Biſhop <hi>Bancroft.</hi> And upon this Reverend Father he gained ſo far, by his neat Wit and decent behaviour, that the Arch-Biſhop ſent for him two years before he was Batchelour of Divinity, and <hi>ex mero motu</hi> gave him the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouzon of an Arch-Deaconry in <hi>Wales (Cordigan,</hi> if I forget not) which came to the Metropolitan by his cuſtomary Prerogative. I am not certain when it fell void, and came to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s poſſeſſion. This I am ſure of, that he ſate in Convocation in the Title of this Arch-Deaconry the year 1613. expiring, when Dr. <hi>Lake,</hi> Holy and Learned Dr. <hi>Lake</hi> was Prolocutor. Sometimes alſo he Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned Lord Chancellour <hi>Egerton</hi> for the ſame Foundation. And in a Lucky hour. For the Lord Chancellour in thoſe Addreſſes quickly found him out, that he was a Jewel fit for his own wearing; which broke forth in due time, as ſhall be comprized in the ſequel. And to riſe up one ſtep more upon the degrees of God's Providence, the Maſter and Fellows aforeſaid deputed him for their Agent to the Court to Petition the King for a Mort-main, thereby to bring ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement to their maintenance. It is no New thing to ſay he ſped in the Suit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for when did he miſcarry? You have him right in that Elogy, which <hi>Aurelius</hi> gives to <hi>Septimius Severus, acer erat ingenio, &amp; ad omnia quae intenderat in finem perſeverans:</hi> His Wit was ſharp, and drew ſucceſs after it, as the Needle doth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49492:11"/>the Thred, and his Induſtry was reſtleſs, till he had his End for which he La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd. The marvel is that his Worth and Activity ſhould make ſuch impreſſion in the King, that his Majeſty upon ſome occaſion told him of it long after, when he was then become His Highneſs's principal Officer.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Theſe were the noted Adventures which our young Academian, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from his College, did make abroad; but his Staple was at his Study at home, where his Light did break out openly in great ſplendor upon this occaſion. On <hi>Candlemaſs-Day Anno</hi> 1608. his Reverend Friend Dr. <hi>Playfere</hi> departed out of this World, in the 46 year of his Life, in his Flower and Prime; whoſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt well-wiſhers did not wiſh him alive again, becauſe his rarely beautified Wits, with which he had even inchanted his hearers in ſo many eſtivat commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were now more and more diſtemper'd. Yet Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> wept over him, and exceeded in Grief, as if a Child had loſt his Father. The Univerſity mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preparation for the Solemn Funeral of ſo great an Ornament to it, the Vice-Chancellour that then was Dr. <hi>Jeggon</hi> poſſeſt the Pulpit to Preach, and Mr <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> was required to be the Oratour, to give him a farewel of due praiſe in the Chappel of St. <hi>Johns</hi> College. He pleaded the Truth, that his ſorrow would not grant him ſuch a diſpaſſionate mind, as was fit to compoſe a Panegyrick and that in the ſpace of three days, and for ſuch a man as Dr. <hi>Playfere.</hi> And with this Excuſe he held off, till Dr. <hi>Clayton,</hi> ſet upon it to enforce the Taſque on him that could beſt diſcharge it, Threatned him with expulſion, if he refuſed that Service to which his Superiours had allotted him. An hard condition, and ſuch as might have been diſputed, as long after I heard him Argue upon it. But then he yielded, whether fair means or foul means overcame him I know not: But I think rather Love than Fear got the upper hand of Grief. And when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his Turn came to ſpeak upon the day of the Obſequies, O what a tunable Muſique he made between his Rhetorique and his Tears! for both flowed together. How curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous were his Apoſtrophes! How moving were his Paſſions? How winning his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation? Many pauſes he was compelled to make by the Applauſe and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Swarms about him in the cloſe of his Periods. When he had done, and the Aſſembly brake up, it was in every Mouth, that <hi>Playferes</hi> Eloquence was not dead with him, while this Orator was alive. Let me trouble this Narration with a ſmall interjection. I was my ſelf in the throng among thoſe that heard this Oration, newly admitted into <hi>Trinity-College,</hi> that being the ſecond day wherein I wore my Purple Gown. This being the Firſt Exerciſe that I heard in <hi>Cambrige</hi> in the Latin Tongue, I thought it was a City paved all with Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldes, and that ſuch Learning and ſuch Silver Elocution was common to them all. But there is a ſaying in <hi>Macrobius,</hi> a great Orator being the Subject, which might have made me Wiſer; it is thus, <hi>ad notam ſeculi ſui non ſufficit Hortenſius.</hi> All men that lived in that Age were not like <hi>Hortenſius;</hi> and among a bundle of Gods, the Poets have feigned but one <hi>Mercury;</hi> and although the ſucceſs of this Funeral Encomium was much to the Authors praiſe, yet I have it from his own Teſtimony, that he never ſuſpected himſelf ſo much as then in all his Life, leaſt he ſhould have ſhamed his own parts, and Treſpaſt againſt the Honourable Memory of the Dead, becauſe his Wits were bedarkened with a Cloud of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But I ſee that falls out otherwiſe, with many more than he imagin'd. The Noble Author of the Hiſtory of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath remembred, that the Letters of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> ween he was ſtruck with horror of Grief for the untimely Loſs of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> I ſay, his Letters conſolatory written in that plunge and amazement of Sorrow to his Siſter the Dutcheſs, were the moſt full, the moſt ſententious, the moſt flouriſhing in Phraſes that ever he wrote. No inſtance can go higher that that of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> whoſe Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and curious Figures in his Lamentations were never matcht: The mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Dove is ſweeter than the warbling of any Nightingale.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Having bought this Credit ſo dear, with the loſs of his deareſt Friend, he grew more conſiderative to look above him, not about him, to the praiſe of God, and not of Men. He had labour'd four years ſtrenuouſly in Theological Studies, and found himſelf in ſome Ripeneſs to do God Service in the Miniſtry. So ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring himſelf in Prayer to him, that alone gives ſufficiency, he received the Orders firſt of Deaconry, then of Prieſthood in the 27 year of his Life. And being recommended to the Grace of God by impoſition of hands, preſently he began to labour in his Maſters Harveſt, and became a Preacher of more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and diligence, than it uſeth to be with Fellows of houſes for the greater part. Who ſtay too much upon their preparation before they buckle to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49492:11"/>work of their calling, like Mowers that are longer in whetting their Sithe, then in cutting down the Graſs. And that the Lord when he came might find him careful in tending like a good Steward over the Houſhold, immediately with the Office of his Miniſtry he took the charge of a Living, the ſcantling of it very mean, and it could be no better after the Letter of the Local Statutes where he Lived, that he might keep his Fellowſhip with it. It lay beyond St. <hi>Edmunds Bury</hi> in the confines of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> (perhaps <hi>Fakenham,</hi> or very near to it) it was the flitting Milk of a poor Vicarage, the Parſonage Tithes being ſcumm'd from it. I know not who preſented him to it, but queſtionleſs the Benefice ſought him, and not he the Benefice. He had a fair Champion Country to Ride over to it from <hi>Cambridg,</hi> which was Exerciſe with breathing in ſweet Air: But the profits of the living would hardly defray the Coſts of his Journeys. The exility of the ſmall Revenue took not off his Edge: For it yielded all out as much as he did drive at, to teach the ſimple, to attain to a readineſs in Preaching, by early and often practice; and to be acquainted with compaſſion (I uſe his own words) towards the hard condition, which his poor Brethren did undergo, that had ſcarce enough to feed them, and keep them Warm for all their Labour. It ſeems the people of the Pariſh were good people, or he thought them ſuch; for in his higheſt Honour I heard him Treating with Sir <hi>Lionel Talomach</hi> of <hi>Faken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that Sir <hi>Lionel</hi> would employ from him an 100 <hi>l.</hi> to buy Land of five or ſix pounds <hi>per annum</hi> Value, for the Relief of the Poor of that Village to the worlds End. I hearkned no more after it: For I reckon'd it was done: Becauſe every place wherein he had a Title was the better for his Charity. If further for a deeper Gage to ſound his Learning, ſome expect to know what he perform'd in St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> rather than in a ſorry Vicarage, I can tell them among others that were preſent, that he publiſht himſelf a moſt rare Preacher in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon made before the Univerſity <hi>anno</hi> 1610. upon this Text, Luc. 16.22. <hi>It came to paſs, That the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into</hi> Abrahams <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</hi> He handled the points of the Souls Immortality, of the preſent Bleſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About Eight Mouths after, being Liſted into the Combination of the choiceſt Preachers: He was call'd to do that Duty before K. <hi>James</hi> and Prince <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>Royſton,</hi> whereupon the King ſpake much good of him, but the Prince taking great notice of him as an Honour to <hi>Wales,</hi> was not ſatisfied to give him encouragement of praiſe, but gave him his Princely Word, that He would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him after the weight of his Worth. But the Father beſtowed that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him, which the Prince, taken away by early Death for our Sins, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. I heard of this Sermon Six Weeks after, and by a merry Token; for having occaſion to come to that hunting Court at <hi>Royſton,</hi> I received Hoſpitality at a Table full of good Company, where I was askt over and over, eſpecially by the old <hi>Brittains,</hi> what Place and Dignity Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> had in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them could tell me he made a moſt Excellent Sermon before the King, but for their parts they had been ſuch attentive Hearers, that among them all I could not Learn the Text.</p>
                  <p>The Fame of our accompliſht Preacher, who had taken the Univerſity and the Court ſo far with his Merits, as none more, ſpread far: And he wanted not Friends in the Lord Chancellour <hi>Egertons</hi> Family to acquaint his Lordſhip with it, who inſtantly preferr'd him before all Competitors, and ſaid no more, but, <hi>Send for him, and let me have him.</hi> This was at <hi>Midſummer anno</hi> 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That Lord Chancellour was a great Patron to Divines, but then they muſt be of many degrees above Mediocrity; and thoſe whom he pickt out for the Service of his Houſe, were of the firſt, and as it were, Seraphical Order.

Happy were thoſe times that heard his <hi>Plinian</hi> Orations (for his Style had that Savour) that heard his <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> diſputations, that enjoyed the Fruit to hear him moderate at the Morning Exerciſes between a Maſter and a Batchelor.

The Night-watches indeed, he committed ſometimes to Deputies, as the manner is, to compel the Looſer ſort from their Haunts of Inns and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, and Houſes of ill Fame. But when he held the Staff in his own hand, he perceiv'd he prevail'd moſt. And it was ſenſible to the Eye, That he reclaimed many from diſorder; not that in all the year he damnified any one by cenſure, that I could hear of: Neither did he uſe to make a crackling Noiſe with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies and Threatnings. But won Regard to his Place by Sweetneſs, by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fableneſs, by Perſwaſions, as dealing with Scholars, not with Peaſants; with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and not with Servants.

Soon after <hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> the Kings Majeſty Commanded the Heads of the Univerſity, to give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as might be prepared of a ſudden, to a <hi>German</hi> Prince, and his Train. It was the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> I cannot err in that I ſuppoſe; for we of the younger fort were taught to know him by that Name; and his Stile at every Word was his Excellency. The Duke was ſingularly Learned for one of that Eminency and Illuſtrious Blood. Therefore it was thought meet to receive him in the Publick Schools with a diſputation in Philoſophy, performed by the moſt expert Profeſſors of it, who were ready, we were ſure, at the ſhorteſt warning. I muſt do him Right to him that was the firſt Opponent, that he charged the Repondent bravely with Arguments of the beſt Artillery. It was Mr. <hi>Wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I look back to my own Matter. Mr. <hi>Prectour Williams</hi> was the Preſident or Moderator at this Learned Act; who by discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as other ſufficiency, outſtript them all.

                  <p n="28">28. The next Paſſage is of another frame; and tried his Judgment, not his Learning. The Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that famous Lord-Treaſurer, had Govern'd our Univerſity as Chancellor from the Year 1600, with good liking to all. <hi>Uxit dum vixit bene.</hi> He leſt this World <hi>May</hi> 24. 1612. In the Election of a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, the Regent-Houſe, in whom the Choice was, were improvidently divided. The greater Number gave their Voices for <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> Lord Privy-Seal, ſometimes a Gremial of our Body, ſuperlatively Learned, a Writer of Books in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, that eſpecially againſt <hi>Judicial Aſtrology</hi> is of as elegant Contexture, as any that are written in more Sunny Climates: Beſide, he was very Rich, and a Batchelor; a Founder already of a charitable and handſom Pile of Building at <hi>Greenwich.</hi> Therefore ſuch as deviſed all good ways to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Benevolence of Liberal and Wealthy Men unto us, hoped he would be very beneficial to <hi>Cambridge</hi> his Mother, which now caſt her ſelf into the Arms of his Governance and Patronage. So far the adverſe Part could not diſlike him. One and the only thing to them of ill digeſtion was, that <hi>Vox populi,</hi> not the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, but the Clamour of Court and Country was, that he was no better then a <hi>Church-Papiſt:</hi> That certainly his Heart was more with the Conſiſtory of <hi>Rome,</hi> then of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Theſe, with whom this Objection ſtuck, were cloſe Students, plain and honeſt Men, the leaſt of all others acquainted with the World abroad. Therefore they run blindfold upon a deſperate way; and to diſcountenance or diſcourage the Lord Privy-Seal, they put one, far better then himſelf, in balance againſt him, the King's ſecond Son, <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> his Highneſs, though then but in the 12th Year of his Age. The Lord Privy-Seal had far more Votes in the Scrutiny for his Election, and ſo it was in all Poſt-haſte ſignified unto him. But he took on with all Impatience to be ſo Abus'd, to be made Competitor with the King's Son, and to prevail in the Election. And the King was more Wroth with the Simplicity, or rather Preſumption of thoſe ſilly Clerks, that durſt Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his Dear and Tender Son the Duke to any Place or Office, before they had beg'd Leave in all Humility for the Royal Aſſent. A few of theſe received a great Check for it at the Council-Table, and were a while under the Cuſtody of Purſuivants. For their Error, the whole Univerſity was under as black a Cloud of Diſpleaſure, as ever I knew it in all my time, and floated like a Ship in a great Storm, that knew not where to Anchor. The King exclaimed at them for Heady, Inconſiderate, ſwayed by Puritanical Factions. The Lord Privy-Seal, the Elect Chancellor, ſhrunk up his Shoulders, and made an Anſwer of fine Words, and well ſet together, 'That he was not worthy to have the Primacy or Pilotſhip 'over the <hi>Argonauts</hi> of ſuch an Argoſie: But in Rude <hi>Engliſh</hi> it was no better, then that <hi>He ſcorn'd their Proffer.</hi> The Lords of the Council told them plainly, <hi>They deſerv'd no Chancellor among the Peerage, who had ſo ſpitefully confronted an Earl of that Eminency.</hi> The Vice-Chancellor Dr. <hi>Gouch,</hi> with the Sophies of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, Reſolved, That this was not a Sore that would heal with delay, therefore they diſpatch Proctor <hi>Williams</hi> with their Letters, to offer himſelf before the King, though the Storm blew ſtiff againſt him. So he came to the Court at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and caſting himſelf upon his Knees before the King with his Letters in his hand, the King, with no pleaſed Countenance, ask'd him what he would have. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my ſelf, and they who ſent me, crave Juſtice of Your Majeſty in the behalf of Your Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of</hi> Cambridge, <hi>which ſuffers under Your Diſpleaſure in that ſort, as I believe never any of Your Subjects did before, that nineteen Parts of a great Incorporation ſhould be Condomn'd, for the Frowardneſs, and that unpreventable by all the Power we had of the twentieth Part, and they the meaneſt of us all.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49492:13"/>bid thoſe that ſent him, to take Courage in looking well to their Charge in the Univerſity. All Errors lately committed were ſtruck off. They ſhould have Power to chooſe their Chancellor; for he would not take their Right of Free Election from them. His further Pleaſure ſhould be declared in his Letters, which would be at <hi>Cambridge</hi> before him, if he made not haſte home. And indeed the Proctor and the Letters came thither both in a day, which being opened, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the Vice-Chancellor, and the Heads aſſiſting, <hi>That they ſhould forthwith call a Congregation, and reſume an Election for a new Chancellor, and that His Majeſty would conſtrain him to hold it, whoſoever it were that the Congregation agreed upon.</hi> The Heads were yet in a Quandary, and knew not well what to do, becauſe the King was not more Particular, and ſeemed to be ill pleaſed with the Proctor, that he had dived no further into His Majeſties Meaning: For they feared to fall upon a new Rock, becauſe His Majeſty had pointed at no Perſon, nor diſcloſed His Meaning by any Decipher or Intimation. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſays the Proctor, <hi>I ſhall help this Miſtake before you ſtir from hence. Certainly there is one Clauſe in the Royal Letters, which ſets up the White at which all our Votes ſhould aim: For none hath declared a flat Refuſal of this vacant Place but the Earl of</hi> Northampton, <hi>therefore none elſe can be meant in this Paſſage, "That whomſoever we Chooſe, the King will conſtrain him to hold. It were not proper to think, that any Grandee in the Realm, beſide that Lord, ſhould need to be conſtrained by the High Power and Prerogative of our Sovereign to be our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.</hi> The Riddle being ſo luckily Unfolded by this <hi>Oedipus,</hi> the Buſineſs was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiouſly diſpatch'd; and then the King confeſs'd, that they had hit upon the Interpretation of his ſecret Meaning. Which abounded to the Praiſe of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi>'s Solertiouſneſs; and indeed in an hundred Inſtances more, he was as dextrous as in this, to hunt upon a Fault, and to recover upon a Loſs: But as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, <hi>Orat. pro Cecinnâ, cujus prudentiam pop. Romanus in cavendo, nunquam in decipiendo perſpexit.</hi> The Lord Privy-Seal ſoon after took his Oath with due Solemnity to be our Chancellor, and gave civil Entreaty when the Eſquire-Beadles, or other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our Body came to him. And we can boaſt of no more that came from him; who went out of the World before his Sickneſs was ſuſpected, <hi>Jun.</hi> 15.16 14.

Dr. <hi>Clayton</hi> the Maſter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s College died, a good old Man, about the beginning of <hi>June.</hi> His Breath no ſooner expired, but the Fellows, who have all Right of Election, firſt began to Confer, and then to Canvas for a Succeſſor. It was ſoon diſcovered that the ſwaying Men, and that were fit for the bandy of ſuch a Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meant to ſet up Mr. <hi>Owen Gwin</hi> one of the Senior Fellows.

Almoſt all the true Children of the <hi>Muſes</hi> bleſs'd their Endeavours that acted for ſuch a Man, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>We wiſh you good luck in the name of the Lord.</hi> But this Patriarch, as I may call him, was not like to carry the day by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the moſt. Too few ſtood up for him, too few by one eſpecially, and that one was Proctor <hi>Williams.</hi> O how could one of his deep Reach, and paſſing great Love to his Society prefer an obſcure one, ſcarce to be named before the Man that had all good Men's Applauſe, Dr. <hi>Morton?</hi> If there be any thing to be ſaid to make it look fair on his part on one ſide, it is this, Mr. <hi>Gwin</hi> had been his Tutor. A high Spirit, of which he was guilty, will rather Treſpaſs, then not repay the leaſt Benefit it had receiv'd. Nay, a wiſe Man dare not incur ſuch a Folly as to be Ingrateful.

For there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that College, whoſe Name is beſt conceal'd, that was a robuſtious driver of Canvaſſes, who took the whole Rule from Mr. <hi>Gwin,</hi> (a ſoft Man, and given alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to Eaſe,) into his own hand, and was like the Major <hi>Domo,</hi> by whom all Suits paſs'd, and every Student ſtoop'd to him for his Preferment: To compare great Things with ſmaller, ſuch another as <hi>Victor</hi> ſays <hi>Mutianus</hi> proved, after he had advanced <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> to the Empire by his Cohorts, <hi>Fiduciâ meruorum factus inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> ſawcy to meddle with all, becauſe he had deſerv'd ſo much, and nothing would content him, unleſs nothing were denied him.

It was time for him, after the Settlement of theſe great Places upon others, to look to his own Place in the enſuing Commencement, which was even ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching. The Inceptor-Maſters by Preſcription have the Right to chooſe out of the two Proctors whom they pleaſe, to be the Father of the Act, as we <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabrigians</hi> call it. It is a ſtrange <hi>Aenigma,</hi> that the Sons ſhould beget their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It lights commonly, as if it were <hi>Poſtulatum Mathematicum,</hi> upon the Senior. But becauſe he that now was the Elder, if ever he had Polite Learning fit for ſuch a Performance, had out-grown it, therefore becauſe he was no Elder that could Rule well, the Inceptors gave the Younger the double Honour. This Commencement was as Gay and full of Pomp, by the great Concourſe of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Gentlemen, as ever I ſaw. The Acquaintance and Fame of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor drew the moſt. The <hi>Welch</hi> Gentry were enough to fill the Scaffolds. Beſide ſuch as repair'd thither at that Seaſon from Lord Chancellor <hi>Elſmore</hi>'s Houſe, and the very brave Attendance of the Lord Privy-Seal, the lately confirm'd Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of the Univerſity, divers others attended the Elder Brother of the Act. Sir <hi>Charles Stanhop</hi> Knight of the <hi>Bath,</hi> only Son and Heir to <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Stanhop</hi> of <hi>Harington,</hi> a comely Gentleman, that took his Degree of <hi>Maſter,</hi> and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd it, as much by the Proficiency of his Learning, as by the Title of his Blood. Theſe Gallants muſt be Feaſted by the Proctor, and there was no Want, I would there had been no Superfluity. Theſe Coſtly and Luxurious Meals are the Lard of our Commencements, thruſt in among the better Banquets of Scholaſtical Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. The Proctors Table was more Sumptuous (I underſtand my Compariſon) for the time, then uſeth to be at a Mayoralty in <hi>London.</hi> I do not reckon it among his clean and unblemiſh'd Praiſes. But if I may preſume to ſit Judge over his Thoughts, I believe He took Parſimony to be moſt uncivil Behaviour. The Prevaricator made me ſmile, when he gave him this Character to his Face, <hi>Titus Largius primus Dictator Romanorum.</hi> To expreſs my ſelf a little further: Theſe Meſſes of good Chear ought to be frankly ſet out at the times of ſuch Genial and Gaudy Days. It were a wiſe World, if they could be kept within Moderation. The wiſe and well-governing Heathen <hi>Romans</hi> had <hi>Leges Cibarias,</hi> as old thrifty <hi>Cato</hi> term'd them: <hi>Leges ſumptum comprimentes,</hi> in the Style of <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apology. I take it from <hi>A. Gellius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 24. that the Sum of 300 <hi>Seſtertii,</hi> and no more were permitted to be ſpent <hi>in feriis Solennibus,</hi> which comes to about 40 Shillings, or a little under, as I caſt it up with my Counters. Yet Liberal <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> indulg'd on ſuch Occaſions the Expence of 1000; his Nephew <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> bounded it up to 2000; which comes not altogether to 15 Pounds of our Money, <hi>Ut his ſaltem finibus Luxuriae efferveſcentis aeſtus coercerctur.</hi> And this was granted only to Senators, the Princes of the World, and not to Scholars, and that neither but, <hi>in Nuptiis &amp; Repotiis,</hi> at the Feaſt of the Bride, and the Repotations of the Bridegroom. I want not Commiſſion to ſpend this little Ink, and it is but very little, upon this Subject. For the Holy Scriptures ſpeak of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Feaſts, as well as of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Wiſdom: Howſoever theſe Junquets, and the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are quickly taken away with a Voider. The Feaſts of his Learning and Eloquence, demonſtrated in the Theatre of the Commencement, (that was the open Houſe-keeping) were far more delicious and ſweet to the Ear, then Meats
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49492:14"/>could be to the Belly. All his Speeches were damask'd quite over with moſt pleaſant Alluſions out of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors. This was the laſt Scene acted on the Stage of that one Year's Office, and it had the loudeſt <hi>Plaudite.</hi> Indeed this was the Vintage, when more then ever before he preſs'd out the ripe Grapes of his Elegancies:

From that Step in the Houſe of Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bancroft</hi> began to riſe higher, till he came to be Metropolitan of all <hi>England.</hi> By the like Service in the Houſe of Lord Keeper <hi>Puckering,</hi> Dr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> firſt made his Abilities known, and afterward got his Prince's Favour to ſit in the See of <hi>London.</hi> Now, the Diſciple whom theſe two great Prelates loved ſo well, performing that Truſt with Lord <hi>Egerton,</hi> which they had done with his Lordſhip's Predeceſſors, was their Match at leaſt in Diſpatch and Judgment; and, by God's Providence, their Equal in Proſperity. Yet before I ſettle him for good and all in this Honourable Family, which will beſt be done in an whole Piece without disjoyning it, I muſt bring him to <hi>Cambridge</hi> again by an Act of Revocation. A fond Mother that dotes upon her dear Son, whom ſhe hath ſent abroad to be Manner'd and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, will pick many Occaſions, after a little abſence, to recal him. But the Expedient, and not the Fondneſs, which made the Univerſity borrow him of the Lord Chancellor his Maſter, after he had been 7 months away, was this: The King's only Daughter, the Glorious Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was married at <hi>Whitehall</hi> to <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince Palatine, and Chief Elector of the Empire at <hi>Shrovetide.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be deviſed to Honour a Royal Solemnity with Bravery, Tiltings, Barriers, Maſques, and all ſorts of Triumphs, which was not uſed and preſented. The Gallantry of the Court having had deſervedly the firſt Place in Celebrating theſe Nuptials, it was Reſolved by the King's Majeſty, That His Son-in-Law the Elector, with the Strangers of the <hi>Platz,</hi> ſhould be received for a Concluſion with an Academical Entertainment at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The Warning coming to Dr. <hi>Carew</hi> the Vice-Chancellor, a Prudent Courtly Man, and very fit for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Matters were put in a ſhort time into Order and Readineſs. The Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> our Chancellor, was expected, for Tradition Immemorial required him at ſuch a ſeaſon; but the frugal old Man appeared not. The Charge of great Fare and Feaſting was not more Coſtly then Welcom to the brave Mind of Dr. <hi>Nevile</hi> Maſter of <hi>Trinity</hi> College; who never had his like in that Orb, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for a ſplendid, courteous, and bountiful Gentleman. His Table was Graced with the Company of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince Elector <hi>Frederick</hi> the Bridegroom, Count <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw, Lodwick</hi> Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> with a moſt comely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Nobles and Gentlemen, both of the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nations. In two diſtinct Nights a Comick and a Paſtoral Fable, both in <hi>Latin,</hi> were Acted before their Highneſſes, and other Spectators, by the Students of the ſame Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. This was Play, the reſt was Work. The Scholaſtical Diſſertations were the Work of the Day, the Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi> being Scaffolded for that uſe.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. The Vice-Chancellor, with the Sages of the Conſiſtory, concluded there ſhould be a kind of Commencement extraordinary to Congratulate theſe Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and their Followers. Dr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> the King's Profeſſor in Divinity, to manage the chief Place in the Chair; Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> to moderate in the Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſputation; and Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> to anſwer upon three Queſtions. The next Care was for Opponents. And Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> was ſo high in the Opinion of all the Learned Doctors, that he was thought upon in his abſence as a moſt Select Antagoniſt for this Conflict, and Letters of Entreaty were directed to him, to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49492:14"/>come and fulfil that part, which, upon Aſſurance of his Sufficiency, was impoſed on him. There was no leiſure for a Demur; the ſtraitneſs of Time ſaid, either do it, or deny it. But he ſubmitted; yet humbly proteſting againſt himſelf from one point of Incapacity, that though he had compleat time from the <hi>Midſummer</hi> elapſed for the Degree of <hi>Batchelor of Divinity,</hi> yet he had not taken it. And without that Title, it was not uſual or decent to ſhew himſelf in the luſter of ſuch an Auditory. <hi>Well,</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Richardſon</hi>) <hi>you ſpeak Reaſon, yet we will not want you at this needful time; for I will teach you how to fill up that empty Circumſtance It will be a fortnight yet before our Royal Gueſts the Princes will come to us: Prefer your two Queſtions</hi> Pro Gradu <hi>this night or to morrow to me. I know your readineſs, that you need take no more time. In five days after I will meet you in the Schools. Incontinently your Degree ſhall be confer'd upon you</hi> Pro More, <hi>or by ſpecial Grace.</hi> He obey'd. And the <hi>Theſes,</hi> which upon allowance of ſuch ſhort time he maintain'd, were theſe: 1. <hi>Peccata ſemel remiſſa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſes,</hi> as it were the Chartel of Challenge, met him in the Schools. He was a profound Divine, as famous in the Pulpit as in the Chair, (which is not uſual) a great Linguiſt, noted for a kind of Omniſciency in Church Antiquities, of pure Language, yet uſed not his Pen to Compoſe his Lectures but brought his Memory with him, and dictated his Mind with great Authority. We that frequented at his Polemical Exerciſes obſerv'd, That if the Reſpondent that ſtood before him were not a luſty Game-Cock, but of a Craven kind, he would ſhake him a little, but never caſt him on his back: But if he were one of the right Brood, that would ſtrike Spur for Spur, he would be ſure to make him feel the weight of a Profeſſor's Learning before they parted. Therefore he did not dally with Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> at this time, but laid at him with all his Puiſſance. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more delightful for two long hours and better to us that were the Lookers on. In ventilating the firſt Queſtion, we judged that the Doctor of the Chair had twice duck'd the Reſpondent under Water, but he quickly appeared again at the top. Once was upon the Objection, <hi>That Original Sin is remuted in Baptiſm, and yet ſome Baptized become Reprobates, and are for ever Tormented. Even ſo</hi> (ſays the Anſwerer) <hi>for their Actual Rebellions, but not upon the ſcore of Original, which was wiped out.</hi> The ſecond Shock was upon that Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.32. where the Lord tells the Unmerciful Servant, that <hi>He had forgiven to him the Debt which he deſired, but ſince he had no compaſſion of his Fellow, he ſhould be kept in Priſon, till he had paid all which was due. Though I might decline the Inſtance</hi> (ſays the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent) <hi>becauſe it is Parabolical, yet to encounter the Text more directly, I ſay, that the Debt was not cancell'd to that rigid and hard Servant, for if he had his Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But,</hi> I forgave thee, <hi>in that Verſe, is as much as, I forbear thee, I did not proſs thee, or exact upon thee. Though the Tally was not ſtruck, yet no Suit was commenc'd, and a Temporary Forbearance is a kind of Forgiveneſs.</hi> The Profeſſor was ſatisfied, and drove his Wedge no further into that Knot. Upon the ſecond Queſtion, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the grave Doctor gave the Onſet ſomewhat frowningly. But the Pith of his Obligation was, That the Vocation to Sacred Orders, <hi>Miniſterium eſt, non mercatura: Piſcatores ſumus hominum, non venatores munerum;</hi> that is, Our holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is a Miniſtry, not a Merchandiſe; that we are made Fiſhers of Men, and not of Livings. The Retorſion to this had Strength and Sweetneſs, like Iron that is gilded; <hi>Alius eſt finis artis, alius artificis:</hi> The end of Theology is to gain Souls; the end of the Theologue, ſubordinate to the firſt and Architectonical end, is for an honeſt Maintenance and Suſtentation. As the end of Art Medicinal is to cure a Sick Man; but the end of the Phyſician is to live well upon his Profeſſion. This agrees with the mind of <hi>Seneca, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De Benef.</hi> That the end of <hi>Phidias</hi> his Art was to carve a Statue with likeneſs, concinnity, and due proportion: <hi>Finis arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficis feciſſe cum ſructu;</hi> The Artificer's end was to take Money for his Work. A Diſtinction that cuts by an even Thread; which, with all that was deliver'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, received great Congratulation from the Profeſſor and Auditors.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. From henceforth he was a <hi>Licemiate,</hi> as the Tranſmarines call it, as we a <hi>Batchelor in Divinity:</hi> A Relation to beautifie his Profeſſion, or rather a mere Scabbard to put in the ſharp-edg'd Weapon of his Learning, out of which he drew it forth upon a fair Quarrel, which was decided before a glorious Auditory, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 1612. That was the day wherein the Princes, with the Attendance of mighty Peers, and one Biſhop Dr. <hi>James Montagu</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> vouchſafed to give a moſt Gracious Hearing to a public Diſputation held between
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49492:15"/>ſome of our chief Divines. The Place was filled with the moſt Judicious of this whole Iſland; and ſome of the Attendants of the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> ſo Learned, that One might ſtand for many, <hi>Plato</hi> alone for Ten Thouſand: One <hi>Abraham Scultetus,</hi> a Worthy greatly look'd upon, was able to awake the Diligence of them that had been Drowſie. But they that were ſet forth for this Encounter had Metal enough, and needed no Provocation, but their own Virtue. Dr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> (<hi>Agmen agens Lauſus, magnique ipſe agminis inſtar,</hi>) began firſt with his grave <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorean</hi> Eloquence, and having ſaluted Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the great expectation of our future Happineſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>G. Nyſſen</hi> calls <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the <hi>Branch of Succeſſion;</hi> and having bleſſed his Serenity the Prince Elector the Bridegroom with Solemn Votes and Wiſhes to be added to his <hi>Hymeneal</hi> Joys, then he called forth the Son of his right hand, Mr. <hi>Samuel Collins,</hi> (created <hi>Doctor</hi> at this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement) to ſtand in the gap, and to maintain the Truth in three <hi>Theſes</hi> againſt all Aſſailants. He was a firm Bank of Earth, able to receive the Shot of the greateſt Artillery. His Works in print againſt <hi>Eudaemon</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Herbert,</hi> Sons of <hi>Anak</hi> among the Jeſuits, do noiſe him far and wide. But they that heard him ſpeak, would moſt admire him. No Flood can be compared to the Spring-Tide of his Language and Eloquence, but the milky River of <hi>Nilus,</hi> with his ſeven Mouths all at one diſemboguing into the Sea. O how voluble! how quick! how facetious he was! What a <hi>Vertumnus,</hi> when he pleas'd to Argue, on the right ſide, and on the contrary! Theſe Things will be living in the memory of the longeſt Survivor that ever heard him. In this Trial, wherein he ſtood now to be judged by ſo many Attic and Exquiſite Wits, he ſtriv'd to exceed himſelf, and ſhew'd his Cunning marvelouſly, that he could invalidate every Argument brought againſt him with variety of Anſwers. It was well for all ſides, that the beſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in my Judgment, that ever was in that place, Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> held the Rains of the Diſputation; he kept him within the even Boundals of the Cauſe; he charm'd him with the <hi>Caducaean</hi> Wand of Dialectical Prudence; he order'd him to give juſt Weight and no more. <hi>Horat. l.</hi> 1. <hi>Od.</hi> 3. <hi>Quo non Arbiter Adriae major tollere, ſeu ponere vult freta.</hi> Such an Arbiter as he was now, ſuch he was, and no leſs, year by year, in all Comitial Diſputations; wherein whoſoever did well, yet conſlantly he had the greateſt Acclamation. To the cloſe of all this Exerciſe I come. The grave elder Opponents having had their courſes, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> a new admitted Batchelor of Divinity, came to his Turn laſt of all. Preſently there was a Smile in the Face of every one that knew them both, and a prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that between theſe two there would be a Fray indeed. Both jealous of their Credit, both great Maſters of Wit, and as much was expected from the one, as from the other. So they fell to it with all quickneſs and pertinency, yet (thank the Moderator) with all candor; like <hi>Fabius</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the one was the Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the other the Sword of that Learned Exerciſe. No Greyhound did ever give a Hare more Turns upon <hi>Newmarket</hi> Heath, then the Replier with his Subtleties gave to the Reſpondent. A Subject fit for the Verſe of Mr. <hi>Abraham Hartwel</hi> in his <hi>Regina Literata,</hi> as he extols Dr. <hi>Pern</hi>'s Arguments made before Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth: Quis ſulmine tanto tela jacet? tanto fulmine nemo jacet.</hi> But when they had both done their beſt with equal Proweſs, the Marſhal of the Field, Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> caſt down his Warder between them, and parted them. A Fable comes into my Memory, That <hi>Vulcan,</hi> to deſpite <hi>Diana,</hi> made a Dog which ſhould catch every thing he hunted, called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Moral in a great part may ſuit well with theſe two unvanquiſh'd Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. The Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> Dr. <hi>Montagu,</hi> gave great demonſtration of Affection to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ever after his Negotiation in this Act. As <hi>Velleius</hi> ſays, <hi>Nulla feſtinatio hujus viri mentionem debet tranſgredi:</hi> That Biſhop was a Reverend and Learned Father in the Church, a moſt loving Son to his Mother the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; he was full of good Works, as <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Farnham,</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter-houſe</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> could teſtifie, if theſe impious and overthrowing Times had let them ſtand, and many more recited by Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi> in his Catalogue of Biſhops.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49492:15"/>This was the good Man, who from henceforth was the trueſt Friend to Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> of all that did wear a Rochet to his Laſt Day; who, after theſe two ſublime Performances of the Reſponſion for Batchelorſhip of Divinity, and Opponent's Place in the Great-Day before the moſt Illuſtrious Princes, retired to his Home, for ſo I muſt now call the Lord Chancellor's Family.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. He was now in the Houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> where every thing proſper'd, and all that pertain'd to him. The Chaplain underſtood the Soil on which he had ſet his Foot, that it was rich and fertile, able with good Tendance to yield a Crop after the largeſt Dimenſions of his Deſires. To be well then, was but to be well now. His fore-caſting Mind thought of the future, how to ſtock himſelf with Experience, with Wiſdom, with Friends in greateſt Grace, with other <hi>Viaticum</hi> for the longeſt Journey of his enſuing Life. Let me uſe the Phraſe correctedly, He lived not for half a Time, but for a Time and Times. He never liv'd <hi>Ex tempore,</hi> but upon premeditation to day what to do long after. As a wiſe Man ſays, <hi>Non diſponet ſingula, niſi cui jam vitae ſumma propeſita eſt;</hi> Sen. <hi>Ep.</hi> 71. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions will be kept in method, when Providence hath affected the Sum and End of them. As at <hi>Cheſs,</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Game muſt be in the Head of the Gameſter, then the Remove of every Cheſs-man promotes it. The Chaplain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his part, as any wiſe Man would, to demerit his Lord with all due Offices, and prudent bearing, and he got it faſter then he fought it. He pleas'd him with his Sermons: He took him mainly with his ſharp and ſolid Anſwers, to ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as were caſt forth at Table to prove his Learning: His Faſhion and Garb to the Ladies of the Family, who were of great Blood and many, was more Courtly a great deal then was expected from a Scholar: He receiv'd Strangers with courteſie, and labour'd for their ſatisfaction: He Interpoſed gravely, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Divine, againſt the Diſorders of the loweſt Servants: And unto all theſe plauſible Practiſes, the Back-bone was continual diligence. Other Things that commended him no leſs, or perhaps more, were theſe: My Lord <hi>Elſmore</hi> was at that time Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford;</hi> whoſe References and Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they were brought before that great Judge, the Chaplain, newly come from the Siſter-Corporation, underſtood them more ſuddenly then all that were about his Maſter; and was cunning at the firſt Opening to propound, how to bring them into the juſt Academical way to be determin'd. And the Opinion which he gave did ſo conſtantly Arbitrate all thoſe Complaints, that the truly admired Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> Dr. <hi>King,</hi> would ſometimes call him pleaſantly, The Chancellor of <hi>Oxford.</hi> The ſecond Part of his Induſtry, to make his Acceptance ſo gracious, was, That he was ſtored with Friends in the Courts of the King and Prince, from whence he gather'd Intelligence fit for the Hearing of his Maſter: Not blind Rumours, or the frothy Talk of the Lobbies; but weighty Paſſages carried in a Miſt before they came to Light: Clouds that at the firſt riſing were ſcarce ſo big as an hand, yet portending mighty Tempeſts when they fell. For he had a Palate to taſte their Court-Wine, when it was working in the Muſt. Every day this Sufficiency grew with him more and more, till he became the only Jewel, which the Lord Chancellor hung in his Ear. Yet in four months after he fell to this Trade, his beſt Cuſtomer fail'd him; the Court of the Prince being Diſſolv'd by the Death of Prince <hi>Henry, Nov.</hi> 6. 1612. with whom ſo much Light was extinguiſh'd, that a thick Darkneſs, next to that of Hell, is upon our Land at this day.

He remitted not the Studies of his own Science and Profeſſion; but having read the Tenures, the Doctor and Student, and ſomewhat elſe like unto them, at hours of Relaxation, he furniſh'd himſelf with no little quantity of that Learning, by Diſcourſe and Conference, and enquiring after ſome caſes how they ſped in the Courts of Juſtice. When he was at a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, he reſpited that Difficulty till he met with Sir <hi>John Walker,</hi> (afterward Lord Chief Baron) whoſe Judgment was moſt agreeable to his Genius. This was his Practiſe, not now, but all along, to gather up more at the Interſpaces of Leiſure, then others do at their Study.

35. Here I will provide a little to ſet my Shoulder againſt the Juſtle of an Objection. Perhaps ſome will ſay, What did the Study of our Laws belong to him? The Dainties of the Scriptures were his daily Diet preſcrib'd him by his Calling. Why did he ſeed upon thoſe coarſe Coleworts? And who could ſpare any of the Time of this ſhort Life, when the Work of a Divine is more then this Life can diſpatch, ſo that the Remainder muſt be learnt in Life Eternal? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to that purpoſe is pithily expreſs'd by <hi>Seneca; Quae dementia eſt in tantâ tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris egeſtate ſupervacua diſcere? Ep.</hi> 48. And what ſay you to the Judgment of Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third, who ſat, <hi>an.</hi> 1216. who forbad all Clerks to ſtudy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or the Pandects of the Laws? Or to the Emperor <hi>Juſtin</hi> the elder, who lived 600 years before <hi>Honorius,</hi> c. leg. 41. <hi>Opprobrium eſt ſi Eccleſiaſtici peritos ſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lint oſtendere legum forenſium?</hi> I ſay, thoſe Laws muſt be weighed with Grains of Temper and Charity. Whom Nature hath made docile, it is injurious to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit him from learning any thing that is docible. Marie he that forſakes his holy Calling, and liſts himſelf in another Warfare, that gives himſelf up wholly to ſcrape a Livelihood from curing Diſeaſes, or fogging in Secular Cauſes, is a Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado, and muſt be brought back again to his Colours with the Infamy of a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But far is he from being guilty of this Fault, who ſerves Chriſt Jeſus faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Labour of the Goſpel, and can do it the better by poizing Humane Laws, and trying how conſonant they are to God's Juſtice; and by ſearching the Virtue of Plants and other Creatures, can find out how wonderful the Almighty is in all his Works. The Collation between <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Imperial Laws, which <hi>Paulus Modeſtinus,</hi> and others of his Robe have made, why may not a Miniſter peruſe it with as much profit as an Advocate? It were a Tyranny, more then barbarous, to confine a Wit, that hath a Plummet to found the depth of every Well that the Arts have digged; or to clip his Wings, that he may not fly into every Buſh as freely as the Fowls of the Air. <hi>Padre Paulo</hi> the Frier, the brighteſt Star in the Hemiſphere of <hi>Italy,</hi> was ſecond to none in Divinity while he liv'd; equal with the beſt Doctors in <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Siena</hi> in explicating Canon or Civil Laws; and above all the Practiſers of <hi>Padua,</hi> or in the World, in underſtanding the <hi>Aeſcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Art, ſays <hi>Fulgentius.

The Lord Chancellor did highly countenance him in it, and was ſo taken with his Pregnancy, that at his leiſure-times, both for his own ſolace, and his Chaplain's furtherance, he would impart to him the Narration of ſome famous Cauſes, that had been debated in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> or <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi> What could not ſuch a Maſter teach? What could not ſuch a Scholar learn? <hi>Socrates</hi> ſays in <hi>Plato</hi> of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> that he Gloried in nothing ſo much, as that he was Ward to <hi>Pericles,</hi> and brought up under him. Neither had this Chaplain a more graceful Ornament to ſhew in the Eyes of the World, then that he was Diſciple to the Lord <hi>Egerton.</hi> That great Senator, the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Judge and Counſellor of his Age, would not have diſparaged himſelf to give a young Divine ſo great a Place in his Affections, but that he had founded him, and diſcover'd him to be a perſon of rare Abilities. By this favour to which he had attained, though he was not in the place of one of the Secretaries, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to be like a Maſter of Requeſts; eſpecially in weightier Petitions he could prevail more then any other Miniſter, which was not to be preſiſted by the other Officers. He had a Mind full of worth, and full of warmth, and no place became him ſo well as the foremoſt; as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays of Cocks, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 21. <hi>Imperitant ſuo generi, &amp; regnum in quâcunque ſunt domo exercent.</hi> None of his Fellows had cauſe to repent, that he rode upon the Fore-Horſe. For he was courteous, and ready to mediate in any Cauſe, and as bountiful as might be wiſh'd; for he left all Fees and Veils of Profit to thoſe to whom they did belong. By this, in a little while, they that would have kept him back at firſt, did their utmoſt to put him forward; which did not need. For the Lookers on did mark, that his Lord did not only uſe him in his moſt principal Employments, but delighted to confer with him; for it is a State-Rule: <hi>Raro eminentes viri non magnis adjutoribus ad gubernandam fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſuam uſi ſunt.</hi> Yet this latter Favour, the Nature of the Lord Chancellor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49492:16"/>conſidered, was greater then the former. For though he was as good a Maſter to his Followers as ever was ſerv'd, yet he was of an auſtere Gravity, and rather Bountiful then Affable. Now though it be as clear as any Ocular Demonſtration, that the Chaplains full and abſolute Parts did introduct him to this Love and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet I will not ſay, but that which brought it to this Growth and Exceſs was a ſympathy of Souls, which is a knitting of Souls by ſecret Ligaments that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend Reaſon.

By this opportunity he interceded, that divers Benefices, which fell to the Lord Chancellor's Preſentation, ſhould be devolved upon deſerving Scholars, and quickly became a great Patron before he was a Biſhop. They were Godly Men whom he oblig'd, and ſuch as had waited long in the Univerſities, and fit to be called forth to uſe their Talents. If he diſpleaſed any in the uſe of this Power, they wey were ſuch as preſumed upon ancient Acquaintance, more then upon their Merit. Pity and Power meeting equally in him, ſwarms of Scholars flock'd about him. Thoſe whoſe Backs were bowed down with tedious and chargeable Suits, he was the Sanctuary to which they ſled; and he refuſed none. This diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Humanity to ſo many that ſtood in need of help, is that which <hi>Marc. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Emperor calls <hi>Natural Duty:</hi>

I have heard ſome of thoſe diſtreſſed ones, that were Strangers to him before, with whom he had never chang'd a word, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to <hi>Cambridge</hi> with Peace and quiet Poſſeſſion of their own, ſpeak of his Goodneſs to Admiration, that he would teach them either the validity or weakneſs of their Cauſe, commend them to faithful Attorneys and able Counſel, work the Officers and Clerks of the Courts to abatement of Fees, thruſt Money into their hands that wanted it, the Nerves of Law as well as of War. Eſpecially if the Cauſe concern'd the Title of their Living, or the Right of their Tithes, he would ſweat and beſtir him for his poor Brethren, and never forſake them, till Sacrilege and Oppreſſion were charm'd with the golden Meet wand of Juſtice. The way that ſome uſe in the manner of their doing a thing, makes them to be rumour'd for their Courteſie above many others, though they do not affect it.

But being of a moſt tender and dutiful Regard to ſuch Reverend Perſons, he did always acquaint his Lord and Maſter with a Breviate of their Grievances, and humbly beſought his Judgment for Support and Remedy; and ſteering by that Oraculous Wiſdom, he never put forth into the troubled Waters for thoſe Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Foundations, but they came merrily to the Haven with <hi>Bon-adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>

His own Share follows: For by coming to that pitch of Intereſt with ſo great and good a Lord, as he befriended many, ſo in the ſpace of about 5 years that he lived with him, he compaſs'd a plentiful Fortune to himſelf, from that Bounty which denied him nothing, and commonly prevented him before he ask'd. Methinks it was that ſweet Patron's Speech, which <hi>Pliny</hi> makes the fruitful Earth to ſpeak to us all, <hi>Lib.</hi> 23. <hi>in Prooem. Ex me parata omnia, ſeſe porrigentia ultro, &amp; ſi pigeat attingere, etiam cadentia.</hi> I have provided all things for us, I offer them to you voluntarily, if you will not gather them, they ſhall fall down at your Feet of their own accord. To be particular, he confer'd the Parſonage of <hi>Walgrave</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi> upon him, and no other Cure of Souls by direct Preſentation. For the Lord Chancellor had declar'd in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> before King <hi>James, pag.</hi> 58. <hi>That he did not diſlike the Liberty of our Church, in granting two Benefices to one Man;</hi> But out of his own private Purpoſe and Practiſe, he diſpoſed ſuch Livings as he gave, that ſome might have ſingle Coats that wanted them, before others had Doublets. But by his furtherance, the Chaplain had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Rectory of <hi>Grafton-Underwood,</hi> in the ſame County, lying in a very ſmall diſtance from <hi>Walgrave,</hi> gratifying the Patron with as good or better in ſome other Shire. Divers Cathedral Churches offered their Preferments to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they needed ſuch a Collegue, and ſome to make amends for his former Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. In the Church of <hi>Lincoln</hi> he was a Prebendary and Reſident, with the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49492:17"/>Chantorſhip of the ſame. He had a Choral Place in the Minſter of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> and in the Churches of <hi>Hereford</hi> and St. <hi>David</hi>'s. Neither the Canons of our Church, nor the Statutes of our Realm, have provided an Incapacity for holding Plurality of Prebends. I find indeed among the Decretals of the Popes, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Urban</hi> the Second, <hi>an.</hi> 1087. running thus: <hi>Licet Epiſcopi diſpoſitione unus diverſis praeeſſe poſſit Eccleſiis, Canonicus tamen Praebendarius niſi unius Eccleſiae in quà conſcriptus eſt, eſſe non debet.</hi> An Order which they keep, till any Man, that hath occaſion to tranſgreſs it, brings enough in his hand to pay for a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe Stalls therefore he poſſeſs'd in Cathedral Foundations, for which the Lord Chancellor was well pleaſed by exchange of ſome of his own Preferments, to make amends to thoſe who had confer'd their Kindneſs upon his faithful Servant. Nay yet further, <hi>Mantiſſae loco,</hi> he gave him a Donative (called <hi>Sine curâ</hi>) in <hi>Wales,</hi> which was equal in Profit to any Endowment that he held. Here was a glut of Preferment indeed, will ſome ſay: Be it ſo; it was the Liberality of a large and a loving-hearted Maſter, that would let him do no leſs; and it is as true, that the Chaplain deſired no leſs. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> lived in the moſt flouriſhing times of <hi>Greece,</hi> and perceiving that the valianteſt Heroes that attended <hi>Alexander</hi> grew very rich, he framed this Axiom, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Nicom. That great Spirits are willing to be wealthy, to reward and gratifie others.</hi> Doubtleſs ſuch as are of an high-flown Animoſity, affect <hi>Fortunas Lacinioſas,</hi> as one calls it; a Fortune that ſits not ſtrait and cloſe to the Body, but like a looſe and a flowing Garment. They would ſpend to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd, and to oblige as far as they can; and that cannot be done out of a narrow Revenue. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> (O what a Miracle of Judgment and Learning!) wrote bountifully, and liv'd bountifully, as I have heard: Theſe are his words, <hi>Lib. de Uſur. p.</hi> 392. <hi>Quomodo liberalis eſſe poteſt, qui nihil plus acquireret, quàm quod ſibi ad victum neceſſarium ſufficere queat?</hi> They that talk of poſſeſſing no more then to content Nature, muſt live with ſuch as know no other People but themſelves, elſe it is impoſſible but they will depart from that Primitive Simplicity. And truly I have known but few, perhaps none, that would not be content to have had all the Chaplain's Portion, or more, if they had liv'd in as good a way of getting. I do not excuſe him therefore, it need not, that he got ſufficient Wealth, and beſtow'd it Charitably, and Honourably, as will be manifeſted. Whither it be <hi>Tully</hi> or <hi>Panaetius</hi> that ſays it, or both, it is well ſaid, as I learnt it in my Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Puerility, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Off.

The Adjection of Wealth then was not to be refus'd, by one that ſerv'd not ſuch an Idol, but made it ſerve him for worthy Purpoſes. Neither did his franc and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Nature eſteem ſuch Things to be the Recompence of five years Service, but this rather, to be brought up at the Feet of the moſt prudent Counſellor that lived in the King's Service, and that he got his Favour ſo early, and held it ſo ſtrongly till Death, which came on apace. <hi>An.</hi> 1616. in <hi>October,</hi> this aged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch began to languiſh and droop. Therefore to recreate him, and to put an after-ſpring into his decaying Spirits, the Prince with due Solemnity being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince of <hi>Wales, Nov</hi> 4. the Lord Chancellor was created Viſcount <hi>Brackley</hi> on the 7th of the ſame. This Honour was a Token that the King held him Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, yet it work'd not inward. Who did ever ſee, that the Sand in an Hour-Glaſs did run the flower, becauſe the Caſe in which it was put was guilded? For all this Viſcountſhip his Feebleneſs was more and more ſenſible, the Eyes that look'd out of the Windows were darkned, and he grew thick of Hearing. From thence, that is about <hi>January,</hi> he delighted not in any Talk, unleſs his Chaplain ſpoke to him. All his Buſineſs with his Great and Royal Maſter the King, he ſent by him to be deliver'd with Truſt and Prudence. Upon which Meſſages the King took great notice, that the Chaplain was Principled by his Maſter to be a Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a Pillar of the Kingdom. And even hard upon the day of his Death, which was <hi>Mart.</hi> 15. the Chancellor call'd him to him, and told him, <hi>If he wanted Money, he would leave him ſuch a Legacy in his Will, as ſhould furniſh him to begin the World like a Gentleman. Sir,</hi> (ſays the Chaplain) <hi>I kiſs your hands, you have fill'd my Cup full, I am far from Want, unleſs it be of your Lordſhips Directions how to live in the World, if I ſurvive you. Well,</hi> (ſays the Chancellor) <hi>I know you are an expert Workman, take theſe Tools to work with, they are the beſt I have.</hi> And he gave him ſome Books and Papers written all with his own hand. Theſe were as Valuable as the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Propheſies. They were that old Sage's Collections for the well
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49492:17"/>ordering the High Court of Parliament, the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and the <hi>Council-Board.</hi> An ineſtimable Gift, being made over to the true Heir Apparent of his Wiſdom. Let every one wear the Garland he deſerves. For my part, I attribute ſo much to the Lord <hi>Egerton,</hi> that I believe the Maſter's Papers were the Marrow of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his Prudence, and ſubtle Judgment in all his Negotiations. Theſe Notes I have ſeen, but are loſt, as it is to be feared, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky and devouring Times. So died that Peerleſs Senator, the Mirror of a Lord Chancellor, having left that Bleſſing to his Chaplain and dear Servant, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed him long after with the mourning of a Dove, and attended his Body to <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and ſaid the Office of Burial over him in a Chapel, where he was entomb'd with his Anceſtors: Whoſe ſurviving Name a Grave cannot cover, and a Tomb is too little to preſerve it. You may meaſure him in much by theſe two Spans: <q>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>

She made him her Solicitor, Attorney-General, Maſter of the Rolls, and Lord-Keeper. She tried him in every Place of Truſt, the former meriting the latter, till he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd the higheſt. King <hi>James</hi> did more, not becauſe he gave him the ſplendid Name of <hi>Lord-Chancellor,</hi> or enobled him with the Titles of a <hi>Baron</hi> and a <hi>Viſcount,</hi> but becauſe in the open Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> he bleſs'd him with his Prayers, (and the Speech wherein he made the Prayer is Printed with his Works) That as he had long held that Place, ſo God would continue him longer in it.</q> To know him altogether, I will borrow the Character of <hi>Aemilianus,</hi> and engrave it into the green Saphir of his Memory, which will ever keep green: <hi>Qui nihil in vitâ niſi laudandum aut fecit, aut dixit, aut ſenſit.</hi>

While the Obſequies for the Entertainment of this deceaſed Lord were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at <hi>London,</hi> the Succeſſor unto the Office of the great Seal was Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> very Learned in the judgment of all <hi>European</hi> Scholars, eſpecially beſt known at home, that his Soul was a Cabinet repleniſh'd with the greateſt Jewels of Wit, and in all our Kingdom none did ever ſet them forth with purer Language. He hearing that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> had cheſted up his Books, and had furniſh'd himſelf every way for an Houſe-keeper to remove to his Cure of <hi>Walgrave,</hi> he made him an offer of great Civility, to continue with him in that place, wherein he had ſerv'd the Lord <hi>Egerton,</hi> which he declined; but with ſo graceful a compliment, that they parted great Friends; and Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> willing to mark him with ſome cognizance of his Love, of his own accord made him Juſtice of Peace, and of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> an Office fitter for none than a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and a Gentleman. Yet he could hot leave <hi>London,</hi> ſo God had provided, without a calling into a new Service, but it was in <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſhold. His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and faſt Friend Dr. <hi>James Montagu,</hi> now Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> ſent for him, and brought him to the King, who received him with conſolatory Words, and extraordinary Grace, and commanded he ſhould be Sworn his Chaplain forthwith, (whereupon he Attended at the Court yearly in the Month of <hi>February</hi>) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him alſo to wait on him in his great Northern progreſs into <hi>Scotland,</hi> now hard at hand to begin in <hi>April</hi> enſuing; and pleaſantly bad him expect the Labourers peny as ſoon as they that had ſerv'd him longer. But the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> made a propoſition before his Majeſty for another employment, and both could not conſiſt together; that whereas the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte much welcom'd at that time, was deſign'd to be preſent at <hi>Cambridge</hi> commencement in the next <hi>July,</hi> that he might behold the Univerſity in the faireſt Trim, and hear the diſputation, the beſt being ever provided for that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> might be reſerv'd unto that time for a double Service, to anſwer publickly in Divinity for the Degree of Doctor, the fitteſt to be the Days-man before that Learned Prelate, and likewiſe give him Hoſpitality, ſuch as a great Gueſt deſerv'd; ſo it was order'd, and ſo it was perform'd. Some men are right Learned, yet with all that worth ſteal out of the World unknown, becauſe it was their ill hap never to be brought upon a Theatre of manifeſtation. And ſome are as Valiant as the beſt, and yet are never praiſed for it, becauſe they were never invited into the Field to ſhew it.

That I may mix ſome Profit to the Reader in this Relation, I will let him know upon what Rules and Reaſons the Reſpondent proceeded in the firſt Cauſe for the Conviction of all Gainſayers, both of the Pontifician part, and of the heady Conſiſtories of ſome Reformed Churches. The Pontifician Rubbiſh he removed away, as a Dunghil of unſavoury Filth fit to be caſt out of the Lord's Vine-yard either becauſe the Popes medled ſo far beyond their own Bounds, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſend out Effulminations againſt Chriſtian Kings in all Countries, upon Arrogation of an Univerſal biſhoprick, which hath the Plenitude of all Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it ſelf alone, to which they have exalted themſelves without Chriſt's War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Seal; or, becauſe by the Declaratory Sentence of their Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they inflict the higheſt Temporal Indignities upon Kings that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd: As inhibiting their Courts of Juſtice to proceed any further, till he that ſits in the Throne ſhall receive Abſolution from their Grace: Abſolving their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from obligation of all Service and Fidelity: Depoſing them from their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and expoſing their Lives to Aſſaſſinate. For though they do not ſay, that ſuch Effects ſhould neceſſarily go along with Excommunication, yet they maintain, That if the Pope ſee cauſe, ſuch Tragical Puniſhments may be annex'd unto it. Far wide from the Truth. For it is evident, that an Excommunicated Perſon can be deprived of nothing by the Church, but that which is enjoyed through the Miniſtry of the Church, and its Priviledges; but how can he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd of that which he holds by Civil and Natural Right, which are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon Spiritual Relations? And as it is expedient to chip away theſe hard Cruſts of Error, ſo neither is the Crum to be digeſted, which likes the Palates of ſome who are devoted to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Diſcipline. A King is not obnoxious to be interdicted, or deprived of the Sacraments by their Aldermen, who can ſhew no more for the Proof of ſuch Officers, with whom they Organize a Church, then the Pope can for his unlimited Juriſdiction. Nor is it to be ſuffered, that they ſhould deny a Chriſtian King to be a Church-Officer properly, and by right of his Crown over Chriſtian Subjects as Chriſtians; whoſe Cauſes can never be ſeparated by their Metaphyſical Abſtractions before diſtinct ſupreme Rulers that are co-ordinate; but that there will be endleſs Jarrs in their ſeveral Entrenchments, and God is not the God of Confuſion. Should he that is next under God in all Cauſes be ſubject to the Courts of his Liege-People and Homagers? He is their common Parent; and the only Mandat how to bear our ſelves to our Father, is to Honour him: But what can make him more vile before the People, then to thruſt him out of the Communion of Saints? Moreover the greater Excommunication includes in it the Horror of Anathematizing, or a Curſe; but, <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought, Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20. Neither would God give a conſtant Power to any which were in vain, and could not ſting. <hi>Vanum eſt quod fine ſuo deſtuuitur.</hi> But it is vain to interdict a King, over whom there is no external Power appointed to bring him into order by Violence and Coercion, if he will not be Interdicted.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49492:18"/>In every Policy there muſt be a Supreme, that can be Judged of none, for elſe the Proceſs between Party and Party would be Circular, or rather Infinite. Theſe Aphoriſms, and abundance more, flowed from the Doctor Reſpondent in the warmth of Diſputation. Above all, his Anſwer was highly applauded, which he gave to Dr. <hi>Richardſon</hi>'s Argument, taken from the Excommunication or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſion, which St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> exerciſed by his Epiſcopal Power over the Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> for commanding a great Slaughter to be made upon the People of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica</hi> in an haſty diſtemper of Anger, before their Cauſe was heard. To which Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, <q>That what St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid, was neither Juridical Abſtenſion, nor Excommunication: It was a private Act of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s, directed by the motion of his proper Piety, and not a Cenſure iſſuing from a Court or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Eccleſiaſtical. And if at the ſame time another biſhop, is of <hi>Rome, Aquileia,</hi> or <hi>Ravenna,</hi> had communicated with the Emperor, and received him to Prayers, and the Holy Sacrament, he might have done it, without the violation of any Canon. A particular Presbyter may do the like at this day, and with a good Conſcience, withdraw himſelf from doing Sacred Offices, if a King, after often and humble Admonition continue Impenitent in great Sins, which the Day light hath detected. Therefore this was no Precedent for the Excommunication of the Supreme Magiſtrate, which was but a particular forbearance of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s in Sacred Duties, not to impact them for his ſhare to ſo great an Offender, whom he left at liberty to all the World beſide to partake with him.

Much was not ſaid to the Second Queſtion, a Buſh that had been often beaten. Yet there was ſome grappling about the new Clauſe, That the Subduction or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of the Cup to the People, maimed the very Prieſthood. But the Doctor maintain'd it thus: <q>That the Order of Prieſthood is a Sacrament in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; the Matter of which Sacrament, by a wretched ſhift, ſome of their Controverſial Writers ſay, is the Bible laid upon the Neck of the Ordain'd, to furniſh him to teach Chriſt's Myſtical Body, together with the Paten and the Chalice put into his hand to authorize him to make Chriſt's Natural Body. If a Prieſt ſo Ordain'd were conſin'd to Pray, and not to Preach to the People, it were a Mutilation of his Office. So if he be ſtinted to diſtribute the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bread, and not the Cup, it is a cutting of one half of his Prieſthood.</q> This was the God-ſpeed and the Good-ſpeed of his Diſputation. It were no Sin to forget the Feaſts he made at this Solemnity. They were bounteous, nay exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, after the uſual Treſpaſs of the ſuperfluity of our Nation: Such as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays <hi>Lucullus</hi> made in his Dining-Room, which he calls <hi>Apollo.</hi> One thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a Smile, That the Doctor was at no little Coſt to ſend to the <hi>Italian</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries at <hi>London,</hi> and to ranſack the Merchants Stores for ſuch Viands as might pleaſe Arch-Biſhop <hi>Spalato</hi> out of his own Country. To which accates he was obſerv'd, that he never put his Hand towards them, but lik'd our Veniſon and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſhes a great deal better, he Thank'd him. But enough of this; for many do not love the ſmell of a Kitchin.</p>

His Brethren the Clergy, both of the better and of the lower Fortune, viſited him much; whoſe Love he repaid with Courteſie, Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and Hoſpitality. He had mightily won the Friendſhip of all the Gentry in the whole Diſtrict about him, and had ſuch favour and countenance from the Nobility likewiſe, that they vouchſafed their Preſence at his Feaſts, but chiefly for his Muſick-ſake, which was the Banquet they came for; and he was furniſh'd very well both for Voices and Inſtruments in his own Family. It was Sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, I confeſs, for one of his Level in thoſe days. But allow him this for the Recreation of his Spirit, the rather becauſe I never knew him ſo much as dip his Senſes in any other Pleaſure. I paſs by theſe Grandees, the Flower of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whoſe Hearts he ſtole with theſe Obligements. But they were the Poor and Needy, for whom he brake his Bread eſpecially, and repleniſh'd their hungry Souls with Goodneſs. <hi>Give a Portion to ſeven, and alſo to eight,</hi> ſays <hi>Salomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 11.2. So he never murmur'd that their Number was too great that came to his Door for Charity.

The Town of <hi>Walgrave</hi> indeed, where he abode, had ſome right to ſhare in his Beneficence above others: And ſo it did. The Labourer, that was ſo near a Neighbour, knew often where to fill his empty Stomach, and the Thirſty where to drink that which would cheriſh him. The Decrepit, the Widow, and the Fatherleſs, reſorted when they pleaſed to the common Refectory of them all. The Sick, who of the Comfortleſs are moſt to be compaſſionated, he came to them to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

No ſooner had he gather'd up this Income, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dole of Fortune fell into his Lap, and much more unlook'd for then the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49492:20"/>other. While the King was in his Summer-Progreſs in the Weſt, the Deanery of <hi>Salisbury</hi> became void by the Death of Dr. <hi>Gordon;</hi> ſtraightway many Eagles were about that Carcaſs, and the Marqueſs of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſtruck in for one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, a deſerving Scholar: But the King gave him a Denial, and ſent for Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> a Man that could not be heard of in a fortnight, as it fell out, till he was found at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> moſt remote from the Court, upon the Duty of his Reſidency. This was the firſt Step of his Dignity, to which no Hand help'd to raiſe him but the King's. He was bereft of his dear Friend Dr. <hi>James Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> who died on the 19th of <hi>July</hi> in the ſame Summer, if my Notes do not err. Beſide him, he had dependance on none about His Majeſty. Yet God moved the King's Heart to confer this Favour upon him, when he did not ſo much as ſtand in His Gracious Sight: But it was better that he was in His Heart. The old <hi>Romans</hi> were churliſh, or rather unjuſt, in beſtowing their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, becauſe none in their Republic might be advanced to an Office, but ſuch as courted the People, and fauned on them for their Suffrages. Their Decree runs thus: <hi>In honoribus conferendis nullius abſentis habeatur ratio. Alex. ab Alexandro, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 3. Whereas Baſeneſs and Ambition are better prevented, when Places of Pre-eminence are caſt upon them, that ſtir not in the Suit, neither aſpire to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. Being ſo ſuddenly admitted into this Deanery, which is as rich as any in the Land, except four, yet he lived not much in that Place. His Predeceſſor Dr. <hi>Gordon,</hi> a Stranger, and unacquainted with our Cuſtoms, remitted the Care of the Church wholly to the management of the Reſidentiaries, grave Men, but ſubtle and attentive to their own Emolument, who contended to keep up the Power they had long enjoyed, when one more knowing and active came into Dr. <hi>Gordon</hi>'s room. Though their Claim were wrong, yet the new Dean, to ſtep out of the way of Contention, appear'd but ſeldom in their Chapter, but repoſed himſelf in the Tranquility of <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> till a better Advancement within the ſpace of two Years releaſed him from thoſe Wranglers.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. As yet then he made his Abode moſt commonly at <hi>Walgrave:</hi> The place was healthful; for no Air is ſo wholſom to a Man, as where he is generally belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Of which Love, his ſhare was the greater, by his Place which he held among them of a Juſtice of the Peace. He was as expert in weilding that Office as any that ſate upon the Bench, not excepting thoſe that wore the Coif. For vouching of Statutes, he needed no Man to prompt him, or to compare Old and New, or to interpret them to their fair meaning. He loved his Country, and was the forwardeſt of any Patriot to defend the public againſt private Engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He was ſtout, and never turn'd his back to oppoſition, chiefly when the Oppreſſions of the poor Clergy did modeſtly call upon him to maintain them in their juſt Rights. It is their hard hap in every place to be trampled upon, not only by ſuch as <hi>Gallio,</hi> that care not for the Things of Chriſt, but by ſuch whoſe Zeal is compounded of contrary Elements, they love the Harveſt of the Goſpel, if you will believe them, and hate the Labourers. But in that County, while Dean <hi>Williams</hi> was preſent, they did eluctate out of their Injuries with credit to themſelves, and damage to their Adverſaries: So much did his Countenance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to their Profit, and their Peace. If private Wranglings were brought before him, he ſeldom granted to thoſe Parties his Warrant to proceed, but counſel'd them, and preach'd them out of their Litigious Humours, ſaying, <q>That it was for Chriſt's Servant to Suffer twice, before he Complain'd once; that Religion was unſpirited without Love; and that Love was a blank without Forgiveneſs; that Variances, when all Charges are caſt up, make the Purſe light, and the Soul heavy.</q> With theſe, and ſuch words, ſome did melt into meekneſs, and ſhook hands, the rather being Reconciled in his Buttry, or his Cellar. But if they did not Edifie with ſuch Homilies, many times he took another, and a ſurer courſe, to pay the Damages all, or in part, which one Neighbour alledged for the matter of his Quarrel againſt the other; till after Experience dear bought, he perceived he was cheated, and that ſome would ſeem to be Foes, becauſe he uſed to be at coſt to make them friends.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. I would he had done himſelf no greater wrong as a Juſticiary: But there was a Miſcarriage, which I cannot paſs over; a great deal of it was Error, but ſomewhat in it hath the wilfulneſs of a Fault. I am not wanton, like the Ladies that lodge about the Piazza in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> to lay a black Patch upon a fair Cheek, where it need not. No; my ſcope is to make his Over-ſight a caution to others. For I intend in all that I write, (I appeal to God; who knows it) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Profit many, then to Praiſe him. Plainly thus it was: Mr. <hi>Lamb,</hi> whom
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49492:20"/>ſucceeding times knew to be Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> came, by holding faſt to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune's middle Finger, from a School-maſter that taught Petties, to a Proctor in Chriſtian Courts, and ſo to an Official. An Official, as <hi>Petrus Blaſenſis</hi> ſays of ſuch another, not from the Noun <hi>Oſſicium,</hi> but from <hi>Officio</hi> the Verb. The Dean of <hi>Salisbury</hi> had occaſion to employ him thrice, or oftner, in thoſe Spiritual Courts, to untangle ſome diſtreſſed Miniſters that ſought unto him, who were catch'd by the Horns in thoſe Thickets. The Official did his work truſtily, and pleas'd the Dean with as great obſequiouſneſs as could be expreſs'd, knowing that he had many long Feathers in his Wing, and was like to fly high. I do not accuſe the Dean, that this Inſtrument was not yet detected to him. For read him what he was indeed out of the Deſcription, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives, <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>Annal. circa finem,</hi> to <hi>P. Egnatius,</hi> Client to <hi>Soranus</hi> the famous Senator; <hi>Cliens hic Sorani autoritatem Stoicae ſectae praeferebat, habitu &amp; ore ad exprimendam imaginem honeſti exercitus, cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terùm animo perfidioſus, &amp; ſubdolus.</hi> Yet this Stoical Gravity did not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal him, but that his needleſs Vexations of harmleſs People, his cutting Fees, his Briberies, and other Muck of the ſame Dunghil made an out-cry, and put the King's good People to ſeek a Remedy, by preferring Articles againſt him at the Aſſizes, where he was charg'd home with an Alphabet of Miſdemeanors. He pleaded to the general, that he was ſo much deſpited, becauſe he had look'd more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into the Diſobedience of the <hi>Paritans,</hi> then formerly had been uſed. My Opinion is, that ſuch <hi>Phyſicians of no value, Job</hi> 13.4. may caſt the Water of ſuch ſick Diſtempers, but will never heal them: Infamous Judges may correct them, they will never rectifie them. For he that is fallen into a Moral Turpitude, is ſoon convinc'd in his own Mind; but he that is miſguided by darkneſs of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, thinks that he doth right to his own Conſcience by going wrong, and is never ſo well reclaim'd, as when he is mildly rebuk'd by them, whoſe open In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Pity juſtifie them, that they walk as <hi>Children of the Light.</hi> But for the Particulars, which laid down ſo many Oppreſſions at the Official's door, they were not Duſt which would be bruſh'd away with the Fox Tail, but Dirt that ſtuck to him, till the Dean, his Mediator, obtain'd from the Judges a Reference to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſome others, for further Examination. By which ſly Diverſion, ſome of his Charges were laid aſide by Compoſition, all of them by delay, and deluſion. After this, (what ſhould be the End of it I know not, without it were to make him look big, and ſuperciliouſly, upon his Proſecutors) the Dean engaged his Friends at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> my ſelf was one that was ſolicited from him, to ſublimate the Official with the Degree of a <hi>Doctor,</hi> wherein he had one Repulſe in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent-Houſe, ſuch an ill reliſh his Name had; but he was carried out in a ſecond day's Scrutiny. But for all his Doctorſhip he was not out of the Brakes, he was but Tapiſht, as Hunters call it. The ſtirring Spirits of the the ſubtle Air of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamptonſhire</hi> prefer'd their Articles afreſh againſt him to the Houſe of Commons aſſembled in Parliament, <hi>an.</hi> 1620. Wedges enough to cleave a bigger Log then Dr. <hi>Lamb,</hi> and yet he was no little one, but <hi>Saginati corporis bellua,</hi> as <hi>Curtius</hi> ſays of <hi>Dioxippus</hi> the Pugil. Well, (nay indeed ill) his Friend that was too ſure to ſuch a branded Man, now become the Dean of a College near to the Parliament, finds the Articles in the hand of the Chair-man of the Committee, appointed to ſift the Complaints, (it was Sir <hi>Edward Sackvil,</hi> afterward the brave-ſpoken Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi>) with whom he wrought to abortive the Bill before it came to the Birth, and ſo he ſet <hi>Dagon</hi> upon his Feet again, <hi>who was fallen with his face upon the ground,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.4. but the palms of his Hands were never cut off, for ſo long as he lived he could take a Bribe. I bluſh to remember, that the Dean did not only ſet him up again as well as ever he ſtood before, but raiſed him higher: For he wrote to a great Lord in Court (the Letter is among my Papers) to procure him the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Knighthood, which was obtained: And when his Enemies laboured to cut his Comb, he got the Spurs. 'Twas pleaſantly ſpoken by Sir <hi>Ed. Montagu,</hi> (ſince that Pious and Loyal Lord <hi>Montagu</hi> of <hi>Boughton</hi>) when a cluſter came about him to ask Counſel and Aſſiſtance for a third Petition againſt Sir <hi>John Lamb,</hi> ſays Sir <hi>Edward, If we tamper the third time, his great Friend that hath already made him a Doctor and a Knight, I fear will make him a Baron.</hi> I have thus much to ſay for the Dean his friend, whoſe very Entrails I knew, that he was ſtrongly eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to love where he had loved, and 'twas hard to remove his Affections when good Pretences had gained them. Chiefly he was of a moſt compaſſionate Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and could not endure to ſee any Man's Ruine, if he could help it. And though Offences were as legible as a <hi>Dominical Letter,</hi> he would excuſe any thing that was capable of an Excuſe, as far as Wit and Mercy could contrive it. But
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49492:21"/>if a little Confeſſion were wrung out, it cut down many Faults to make him ſee as it were a Glade of Repentance in a Grove of Sins; and did ever hope for better Fruits upon eaſie and formal Promiſes. Let <hi>Quintilian</hi> help me out a little more in his ſixth Declam. <hi>Si anguſtus ſaltem detur acceſſus, per quem intrare huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit as poſſit, vera clementia occaſione contenta eſt.</hi> Yet <hi>David</hi>'s Rule is better then all this, <hi>Be not merciful to them that offend of malicious wickedneſs, Pſal.</hi> 59.5. And our God is ſo merciful, that whoſoever adds a dram beyond his Pattern, it muſt be reckoned for fooliſh and hurtful Lenity. Certainly God was not pleaſed, that the Dean would ſave a Man whom He meant to deſtroy, 1 <hi>King,</hi> 20.42. And though it ſlept Unpuniſhed about 12 Years, yet in the end the Lord awaken'd it with a Miſchief, through the treachery of that Man, whom himſelf had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. That which I have hitherto paſs'd over, was but his low and ſhrubbiſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, compared with that Acceſs, which the Providence of God in ſhort time after did caſt upon him. Which Providence is Religiouſly appeal'd to in all things; yet without any check to Reaſon and Experience, to trace it in its Manifeſtations. The Omni-regency of Divine Providence is the Tree of Life in the midſt of the Garden of the World; the Strings of whoſe Root are ſecretly interwoven with all Works and Motions. But the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> are not content, unleſs they taſte of the Tree of Knowledge, and have a Luſt, as far as Curioſity can pry, to learn how God doth put the Iſſue of his Wiſdom into outward, and Inſtrumental Cauſes. I am ready therefore to ſhew what Men will ſeek, the Occaſions which were in the way, and who was Lord of the Aſcendant, when God did raiſe up this his Servant, <hi>that he might ſet him with Princes, even with the Princes of his People, Pſal.</hi> 113.8. His Abilities were worthy of a great Place; none ſo Emulous, or ſo Envious that denied it. Neither was there any Church-man in his time ſo likely to purchaſe a great Place with thoſe Abilities. He that will will read <hi>Budaeus</hi> his Epiſtle to his Notations upon the Pandects, ſhall find this Character of Monſ. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganay</hi> Chancellor of <hi>France, Cujus ea vis fuiſſe ingenii at que animi cernitur, ut quocun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que loco natus eſſet, in quodcunque tempus incidiſſet, fortunam ipſe ſibi facturus videretur.</hi> A Word as fit for him that kept the Seal of <hi>England,</hi> as for him that kept the Seal of <hi>France:</hi> In what Kingdom ſoever he had been born, in what Age ſoever he had lived, he would have ſhared with them, that had a conſiderable part of Honour and Dignity. Certainly he was embued with that Wit, and Spirit, that he need not lag after the Train of Preferment, unleſs he would. And I dare not ſay, he would. For they that are ſanguine, and of a ſtirring temper, which was his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, love to take the right hand. I muſt be thus far bold, becauſe I write not of an Angel, or a Soul among the <hi>Beati,</hi> but of a Man, conſiſting of Humane Deſires and Paſſions. And he that deſcribes an ingenious active Man, without ſome addition to Honour and Greatneſs, makes him not Laudable, but Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.

He never met with any before, no not the Lord <hi>Egerton,</hi> much leſs with any after, that loved him like King <hi>James</hi> at the full rate of his worth. That King's Table was a trial of Wits. The reading of ſome Books before him was very frequent, while he was at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt. Otherwiſe he collected Knowledge by variety of Queſtions, which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out to the capacity of his underſtanding Writers. Methought his hunting Humour was not off ſo long as his Courtiers, I mean the Learned, ſtood about him at his Board. He was ever in chaſe after ſome diſputable Doubts; which he would wind and turn about with the moſt ſtabbing Objections that ever I heard. And was as pleaſant, and fellow-like in all thoſe Diſcourſes, as with his Huntſmen in the Field. They that in many ſuch genial and convival Conferences were ripe and weighty in their Anſwers, were indubiouſly deſigned to ſome Place of Credit and Profit. Wherein he followed the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> as <hi>Spartianus</hi> remembers it; <hi>Omnes profeſſores &amp; honoravit, &amp; divites fecit, licet eos quaeſtionibus ſemper agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit.</hi> But among them all, with whom King <hi>James</hi> communed, <hi>was found none like Daniel, c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19.

There was not a greater Maſter of Perſpicuity, and elucidate Diſtinctions; which look'd the better in his <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that ran ſweet upon his Tongue, eſpecially being ſet out with a graceful Facetiouſneſs, that hit the joint of the Matter: For his Wit, and his Judgment, never parted. If the King lead him quite out of the rode of Verbal Learning, and talk'd to him of real and gobernative Wiſdom, he pleas'd his Majeſty moſt of all, becauſe his Anſwers diſcover'd, that he loved to ſee through the preſent to the future. Chiefly ſince he would be bold, not only to argue, but to quarrel againſt Innovations. For though he was never addicted to his own Opinions, no not among his Inferiors, with that pertinacious Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for better for worſe; yet neither his beſt Friends, nor the higher Powers, could ever get him pleas'd with new Crotchets, either in Church or State. His conſtant Rule was, That old Imperfections were ſafer then new Experiments. To which purpoſe, a Saying of his was famous in Court. The manner how it came in, was thus: A great Servant to the King preſs'd for a change of that, which was well enough already, and commended his Deſign by this Note, That it would be an eaſier way for the People. <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Williams</hi>) <hi>a Bed is an eaſie Repoſe, but it is not wholſom to lie upon a new Tick, and new-driven Feathers.</hi> All theſe Paſſages the King conſider'd from time to time; <hi>Multa viri virtus animo, &amp;c.</hi> And was glad he had a Servant to be raiſed up, of whom He thought as <hi>Cicero</hi> did of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius Valerius,</hi> lib. 3. <hi>de Leg.

I pray the Reader to conſider the ſweetneſs of this King's Nature, (for I aſcribe it to that cauſe) that from the time he was 14 Years old and no more, that is, when the Lord <hi>Aubigny</hi> came into <hi>Scotland</hi> out of <hi>France</hi> to viſit him, even then he began, and with that Noble Perſonage, to claſp ſome one <hi>Gratioſo</hi> in the Embraces of his great Love, above all others, who was unto him as a <hi>Parelius;</hi> that is, when the Sun finds a Cloud ſo fit to be illuſtrated by his Beams, that it looks almoſt like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sun. At this time, upon which my Pen drops, the Marqueſs of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was the <hi>Parelius.</hi> He could open the Sluce of Honour to whom, and ſhut it againſt whom he pleaſed. This Lord was our <hi>Engliſh Alcibtades</hi> for Beauty, Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Bounty, and for Fortitude wanted nothing of Man enough, ſays <hi>Art. Wilſ. p.</hi> 223. who favours all Republicans, and never ſpeaks well of Regians, (it is his own diſtinctions) if he can poſſibly avoid it. The Marqueſs by Sweetneſs as much as by Greatneſs, by Courteſie as well as by Power, pluck'd a world of Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to him, eſpecially by his generous and franc Uſage: For he did as many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the King's Servants and Subjects freely and nobly, that is, without the ſordid Fee of Gifts and Preſents, as ever any did that ruled the King's Affections. Some of the moſt honoured Ladies of his Blood have told me, That there was a Chopping-taker in his Family, that was leaſt ſuſpected; but his Lordſhip's Hands were clean, and his Eyes could not look into every dark corner. Dr. <hi>William,</hi> was aware, that this was the Man, by whom the King delighted to impart his Bounties. <hi>Aemilio dabitur quicquid petit: Juv. Sat.</hi> 7. The Doctor had crept far, as I may ſay, for Ground-Ivy, he had a plentiful Fortune. But he muſt claſp upon this Tree, or none, to trail and climb: Yet hitherto he had not come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one ſtep to gain him. One time he made a Repetition of his former Life unto me, being under a great Sickneſs at <hi>Buckden,</hi> when he taught me two Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons, why he moved ſo ſlowly to the Protection of that great Lord, with this ſolid and ingenious Confeſſion. Firſt, To whom a Man is obliged for his Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, it is expected he ſhould run the ſame hazard with him: Which is ſo far from Slavery or Weakneſs, that it may well be called, <hi>The height of Magnanimity;</hi> no Virtue being more truly Heroical then Thankfulneſs, by which the Spirit of a Man advances it ſelf with confidence of Acceptation to the Love of God and Man. This Conſideration ſeriouſly taken, he was afraid of that Lord's continuance, the Title of a <hi>Favourite</hi> being ſo Inauſpicious in almoſt all Examples. For what is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49492:22"/>more likely, but that a Sail will break, when it is too much ſtretch'd with the ſore Wind? And whoſoever builds unto a lofty height upon a new Foundation, Envy will pull him down by inſenſible Demoliſhments. For new Men, when they become Plenipotentiaries, all Suits at Court paſſing by their Aſſiſtance, they pleaſe few, (who are the Gratified) in compariſon of the Swarms that muſt be repulſed; ſo that if an Eddie and Mutation fall heavy, they are loſt without much Pity; not becauſe they were bad, but becauſe they were great. And take all others into this Moral Compaſs, who were unconcerned; who is ſo upright in his Candor, that gapes not for the removal of the greateſt Actors in Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon a Dream of better days to follow the Alteration? And commonly they that are born to waft over the Sea of this Life in a Cock-boat, are glad to ſee their Shipwreck that ſail in the <hi>Argoſie.</hi>

It would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore, if a great Favourite could act his part to come off the Stage with Applauſe, in whom this double Miſery concurs, the Favour that he takes from his Chief is odious, the Favour that he gives to his Confidents is dangerous.

Now the ſecond Reaſon ſaid this wiſe Man, which kept him ſuſpenſive, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould ſeek a Lift higher in the World by the courteſie of that Lord's Power, was, That he ſaw his Lordſhip was bred in a great Error, he was ſo ready to caſt a Cloud ſuddenly upon his Creatures, and with much inconſtancy to root up that which he had planted. A fault too patent againſt all Apology. He had chang'd the White Staves of the King's Houſhold, the Secretaries, the Maſters of the Court of <hi>Wards,</hi> the Chancellors of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and many others. Partly it happen'd, becauſe freſh Undertakers came with Proffers and Forecaſts, which had not been made before. Preſently ſome muſt be diſcarded, to make room for thoſe, who albeit in their Diſcharge they did leſs then their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, yet they outbid them in Promiſes. And partly, which goes together, his Lordſhip was of very deſultorious Affections, quickly weary of thoſe whom he had gratified, and apt to reſume his Favours to make Trial upon others, if they would obey his Commands upon undiſcourſed Obedience. A Prognoſticator might have gueſs'd upon every Day of the Year, while he was glorified in his Greatneſs, ſomewhat variable Weather. From whence it came to paſs, that his Lordſhip was often ſerved by bad Inſtruments; for they made too much haſte to Rich, becauſe they knew their Turn was quickly coming to be ſhifted. And it is a weak part to blaſt the good Turns which a Man hath done, to loſe his Thanks, and the Fidelity of his Clients.

                     </gap>, to confer much with a Man's own Mind. From both thoſe Reaſons he concluded, to give way to others to ſeek the Lord Marqueſs, who were bolder then himſelf. For why ſhould he render himſelf as an Hoſtage to Fortune, when he needed not? Or what could mend his preſent Condition but a contented Mind? <hi>Pol ſi eſt animus aequus tibi, ſatis habes qui vitam colas.</hi> Plaut. Aul.

Though theſe things were ſo maturely conſidered, an Occaſion came about, which did lead him quite aſide; yet it was in the King's High-way. He was at <hi>Royſton</hi> in Attendance on the King, and in the Marqueſs his Abſence. The King abruptly, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Diſcourſe on foot, asked him, When he was with <hi>Buckingham? Sir,</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>I have had no buſineſs to reſort to his Lordſhip. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoe'er he is, you muſt preſently go to him upon my Meſſage,</hi> ſays the King. So he did that Errand, and was welcom'd with the Countenance and Compliments of the Marqueſs, and invited with all ſweetneſs to come freely to him upon his own Addreſſes. Who mark'd rather from whom he came, then to whom he was ſent: And gather'd from the King's Diſpatch, That His Majeſty intended that he ſhould ſeek the Marqueſs, and deſerve him with Obſervance. From henceforth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it; yet not to contaminate his Lordſhip with Bribery, or baſe Obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but to ſhew himſelf in ſome Act of Truſt and Moment, that he was as ſufficient to bring his Lordſhip's good Ends to paſs, as any whom he employed, both with readineſs to do, and with judgment to do well. Which thus ſucceeded to his great Commendation. My Lord Marqueſs was a Batchelor, and ripe for a gallant Wedlock His Youth, his comely Perſon, his Fortunes plentiful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, his Favour he held with the King, being as much, or more, then the Cardinal-Nephews in the Pope's Conclave: What Graces could be ſweeter in the Girdle of <hi>Venus</hi> that the Poets ſpeak of, <hi>Ceſtum de Veneris ſinu calentem?</hi> Martial. He could not ſeek long to be entertained, who was ſo furniſhed for a Suitor. The Lady with whom he deſired to match, was Lady <hi>Katherine Manners,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and only Child ſurviving, to <hi>Francis</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland.</hi> Hereby he ſhould marry with a Perſon of Honour, her Family being very anciently Noble, and draw to his Line an acceſs of Wealth and Revenue, as the like not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Daughter of any Subject in this Realm. The Motion was ſet on foot in the beginning of the Year 1520, which ſtuck at two Objections. The Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> was ſlow, or rather fullen, in giving way to this luſty Woer; who came on the faſter, directed it ſeems by Proverbial Wiſdom, <hi>That faint Heart never won fair Lady.</hi> Certain it is, that he kept not ſuch diſtance in his Viſits, as was required. Which put the Earl into ſo ſtrong a Paſſion, that he could not be mitigated, though great Ones had attempted the Pacification. In this diſtraction Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> took the opportunity to go between the great Men, and to Umpire the Controverſie. He had often in former times made Journeys from <hi>Lincoln</hi> to viſit the Earl at his Caſtle of <hi>Belvoir,</hi> who was Lord-Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and held ſome Leaſes of that Church, whereof the Doctor was a Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiary, and Precentor. The Earl had found him ſo true and fortunate in many Offices of Service, which he had manag'd for his Lordſhip's ſake, that he prefer'd him before all his Neighbours for Wiſdom and Fidelity. Therefore he gave him very patient Hearing to his Propoſitions about the Lord Marqueſs his Amours, and took down the heat of Inflammation with cool Advice. All youthful Dalliances were clear'd from ſiniſter Jealouſie, and had Allowance to be inoffenſively conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. To ſpeak all together: The Doctor brought the Earl about ſo dextrouſly with his Art and pleaſant Wit, that his Lordſhip put it into his hands to draw up
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49492:23"/>all Contracts and Conditions for Portion and Joynture; which he did to the fair ſatisfaction of both ſides, the noble Earl being ſo glad of a good Underſtanding between him and the Lord Marqueſs, that the Counſellor at his Elbow induced him to ſettle more upon the Marriage, then the Marqueſs and his Mother had demanded. The firſt Door that was ſhut againſt the young Lord in <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Court was thus opened to him. Nothing is ſo good to ſoften that which is hard, as the Language of a diſcreet Man. Therefore the old <hi>Gauls</hi> did carve the God of <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> not after the ſhape of <hi>Mercury,</hi> but of <hi>Hercules,</hi> ſays <hi>Lucian,</hi> carrying his Club in one hand, his Bow and Shafts in the other: But innumerous ſmall Rings were drawn through his Tongue, to which a multitude of Chains were faſten'd, that reach'd to the Ears of Men and Women, to which they were tied; meaning by this Picture, that he performed all his hard Labours by his Tongue, and not by his Club: <gap reason="foreign">

Of whoſe Performance, the Mother-Counteſs, her Noble Son, with the Ladies of the Kindred, gave the beſt Account to the King that Thankfulneſs could make.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. The King commended it; and was right glad that they were well out of the Mire, where they all ſtuck before. And now the Progreſs of the Suit ſeemed ſo eaſie, as if a pair of Doves might draw the Chariot of Love; when His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty put a ſtrong Spoke into the Wheel, which I may call <hi>The Second Obſtruction.</hi> For the Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> though ſhe and her Family were not rigid forbearers of our Church, yet ſhe was bred a Papiſt. This was no Straw at which the King ſtumbled: For he knew it would ſad the Spirit of ſome good People, moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Religion eſtabliſhed, when they ſhould hear, that the Noble-man in whom His Majeſty did moſt delight, was wedded to a Lady of that diſaffected Superſtition. Therefore he liked not that the Marqueſs ſhould proceed in that Marriage, till the Lady were tried with ſweet Perſwaſions to ſerve God, together with her Husband, conſtantly, and without Hypocriſie, after the Confeſſion of the Reformed Church of <hi>England.</hi> So His Majeſty called for Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and laid his ſtrict and higheſt Commands upon him, to uſe his beſt Skill upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of that tender Lady, miſled by Education, to make her a true Proſelyte: Before that was done, He would be loth to give his Bleſſing to the Nuptials. This He required of him, before all his other Chaplains, as well becauſe he had the Ear of the Family more then any Man of his Coat, whereof Proof was made in his late Actions; as becauſe he knew he had the Gift of Wiſdom, mixed with Learning, to cure a Corruption in Opinion. <hi>Sir,</hi> (ſays the Doctor) <hi>I obey Your Commands with all my heart, and with belief of ſome Succeſs. But in caſe upon the firſt or ſecond Conference I bring the young Madam to ſome Acceſs towards the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>without a total Receſs from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>will Your Majeſhy diſcomſit a good Beginning, and ſtay the Marriage, whoſe Conſummation is every day deſired, becauſe the Party is not brought to the perfection of an abſolute Convert?</hi> To which the King anſwered, <hi>I know that commonly Grace proceeds by degrees in conception, and building up its Features, as well as Nature; but though you walk ſlow, walk ſure. I cannot abide to be cozen'd with a Church-Papiſt.</hi> So the Doctor received his Commiſſion chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from His Majeſty; the rather, becauſe though he cunningly concealed how far he had entred, yet he had aſſayed before, to bring the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> into a good liking of our Church with many ſtrong and plauſible Arguments, and found her Tractable and Attentive. She eaſily perceived, that Conjugal Love would be firmeſt and ſweeteſt, when Man and Wife ſerved God with one Heart, and in one way, and were like the <hi>two Trumpets of Silver made of an whole Piece,</hi> Num. 10.12. And quickly ſhe was confirmed by divers and ſolid Repreſentations, to confeſs that our Cathechiſm was a plain Model of Saving Truth; and the Form of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony in our Liturgy pleaſed her abundantly, being as pious and forcible as any Church could make, to bind up a ſanctified and indiſſoluble Union. And after ſome Prayers made to God for his ſecret Breathings into her, ſuch eaſie Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations were ſpread before her, that ſhe confeſs'd our Miniſters were fit Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Ordinances of God, and all Goſpel-Bleſſings from Chriſt Jeſus. So the ſecond Obſtruction was maſter'd by the good Spirit of God, and this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Induſtry. The Remotion of two ſuch Impediments is not commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd by one Head-piece. Sometimes it is ſeen, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſays, yet very ſeldom, <hi>Ut idem pectus &amp; agendi, &amp; diſputandi facultate ſublime ſit.</hi> Lib. 2. de Som-Scrip. c. 17. Now all things being made ſmooth for Love and Concord, on the 16th day of <hi>May,</hi> 1620. the Nuptials were celebrated between the Lord Marqueſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49492:23"/>and his Bride, the Lady <hi>Katherine Manners,</hi> at <hi>Lumly-Houſe</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> lay, Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> joyned them together with the Office of our Liturgy; all Things being tranſacted more like to Privacy, then Solemnity, to avoid the Envy of Pomp and Magnificence. I have been no larger then there was cauſe in this Report; for the Negotiation in this Marriage, ſaid the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor often unto me, was the laſt Key-Stone that made the Arch in his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. It behoved him therefore to ſpare no Pains, nor Study, to ſeaſon the new Marchioneſs with ſuch a meaſure of Knowledge, as might keep her found in the Integrity of Truth. He needed not a Remembrancer to keep his Diligence waking. Yet the King was ſo intent, that the Lady ſhould become an upright and ſincere Proteſtant, that he propoſed to his Chaplain, now her Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to draw up a pretty Manual of the Elements of the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Religion, with which ſhe might every day conſult in her Cloſet-Retirements, for her better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. A Book was Compiled accordingly, but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, put forth, and not put forth. Twenty Copies were printed and no more, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Author's Name, (in a Notion common to many) <hi>By an old Prebendary of the Church of</hi> Lincoln. The Copies were ſent to the Lord Marqueſs, and being no more, are no more to be found; for I have ſearched for one, but with loſt La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. I can truly ſay I have ſeen one, and read it about 30 Years ſince, which being in a negligent Cuſtody, is miſcarried. It contents me better, that I have a written Copy, out of which it was printed; by which the Author could ſet it in order for the Preſs, ſurer then I can now. If I ſhould miſs to digeſt the Expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Interlinings, and Marginal References, as they were intended, I ſhould make the Work differ from it ſelf, though quite againſt my will. But becauſe it is a Golden Medal, and ſit to be worn like an Amulet againſt Seducers, when this Web is ſpun and woven, which I have in hand, I will try my beſt Skill, though a weak <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> to faſhion it into Native Contexture. And if I can truly affirm it to be the very Mantle which fell from <hi>Elijah,</hi> it ſhall be forth-coming in a Wardrode in the end of the Book. If I fail in that, (I do not deſpair) let this Letter, ſent with the 20 Copies to the Lord Marqueſs, diſcover what ſappy Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels were in that Pomegranate.</p>

I perceive by the Date of this Letter, that the Book was printed ſix months after it was beſpoken, which could not be help'd, becauſe the Author was taken up almoſt all that Summer in making a progreſs to ſurvey the Lands of the College of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> whereof he was become Dean by the Lord Marqueſs's Favour,

                  <p>I obſerve, out of theſe Lines, a Precedent for Suitors and Candidates of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Promotions, that he neither extorted his Place by Importunity, nor inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it by Impudency, nor lick'd it out of the Duſt by Flattery, nor bargain'd for it by Simony, or the mollifying Term of Gratuity; in a word, he did not diſhoneſt himſelf for it with any Indignity.

For my own part, I take no little Joy to recount, that this College was ſo happy in ſuch a Man, and the Liberty of that City in ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. It was the Soil of my Birth, and my Breeding. There I ſerv'd this good Maſter, when I came out of the Univerſity firſt into the World, there he paid me my Wages, my Livelihood, which, with God's Bleſſing, I owe to him alone.

                  <p n="54">54. His Predeceſſors (whoſe Names and Actions are not forgotten) were Men of good Report. Two above all, becauſe none were comparable to them, he caſt in his Head to imitate, Abbat <hi>Iſlip,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> for advancing Learning in the School, Abbat <hi>Iſlip</hi> for his Coſt expended upon the Fabric of the Minſter, and the Dean's place. I diſpoſe it ſo, to mention firſt what a Foſter-Father he was to the Scholars, becauſe himſelf proceeded to greater Deſignments by that Order. He had heard much what Pains Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> did take both day and night to train up the Youth bred in the public School, chiefly the <hi>Alumni</hi> of the College ſo called. For more certain Information, he called me from <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> in the <hi>May</hi> before he was Inſtalled, to the Houſe of his dear Couſin Mr. <hi>Elwis Winn</hi> in <hi>Chancery-Lane,</hi> a Clerk of the Petty-Bag, a Man of the moſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49492:24"/>general and gracious Acquaintance with all the great Ones of the Land that ever I knew. There he moved his Queſtions to me about the Diſcipline of Dr. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</hi> I told him how ſtrict that excellent Man was, to charge our Maſters, that they ſhould give us Leſſons out of none but the moſt Claſſical Authors; that he did often ſupply the Place both of Head School-maſter and Uſher for the ſpace of an whole week together, and gave us not an hour of Loitering time from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to night. How he cauſed our Exerciſes in Proſe and Verſe to be brought to him, to examine our Style and Proficiency. That he never walk'd to <hi>Cheſwick</hi> for his Recreation, without a brace of this young Fry; and in that way-faring Leiſure, had a ſingular dexterity to fill thoſe narrow Veſſels with a Funnel. And, which was the greateſt burden of his Toil, ſometimes thrice in a week, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times oftner, he ſent for the uppermoſt Scholars to his Lodgings at night, and kept them with him from eight till eleven, unfolding to them the beſt Rudiments of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, and the Elements of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Grammar, and all this he did to Boys without any compulſion of Correction; nay, I never heard him utter ſo much as a word of Auſterity among us. Alas! this is but an Ivy-Leaf crept into the Laurel of his Immortal Garland. This is that <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Ointment of whoſe Name is <hi>ſweeter then all Spices, Cam.</hi> 4.10. This is that celebrated Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> whoſe Learning King <hi>James</hi> admired above all his Chaplains; and that King, being of moſt excellent Parts himſelf, could the better diſcover what was Eminent in another. Indeed he was the moſt Apoſtolical and Primitive-like Divine, in my Opinion, that wore a Rochet in his Age; of a moſt venerable Gravity, and yet moſt ſweet in all Commerce; the moſt Devout that ever I ſaw, when he appeared before God; of ſuch a Growth in all kind of Learning, that very able Clerks were of a low Stature to him: <hi>Coloſſus inter icunculas;</hi> full of Alms and Charity; of which none knew but his Father in ſecret: A certain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to Scholars of Fame and Ability, and chiefly to thoſe that never expected it.

Or how durſt I omit it? For he was the firſt that planted me in my tender Studies, and water'd them continually with his Bounty. The Occaſion that brings in this, was the new Dean's addition to his Pattern, that looking into ſuch a Mirror, he might keep up the Learning of that happy Plantation, that it might never hear worſe, then as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> teſtifies for it, <hi>Felix eruditorum in Eccleſiam &amp; Rempublicam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus.</hi> Eliz. p. 61. Fol. In his Zeal to this Work, as ſoon as he was poſſeſs'd of the Deanery, he was aſſiduous in the School, and miſs'd not ſometimes every week, if he were reſident in the College, both to dictate Lectures to the ſeveral Claſſes, and to take account of them. The choiceſt Wits had never ſuch Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for Praiſe, and Reward. He was very Bountiful in both, and they went always together, ſcattering Money, as if it had been but Dung to manure their Induſtry. And ſeldom he did fail, no not when he kept the Great-Seal, to call forth ſome of them to ſtand before him at his Table, that in thoſe intervals of beſt Opportunity he might have account of their Towardlineſs; which ripen'd them ſo faſt, made them ſo Prompt and Ingenuous, that the number of the Promoted to the Univerſities, which ſwarm'd out of that Stock, was double for the moſt part to thoſe that were Tranſplanted in the foregoing Elections.</p>

The Buildings of Abbat <hi>Iſlip,</hi> Monuments of a great worth, were the next Object of his Emulation. That wife and holy Man was the Lord Abbat over the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks, who profeſs'd their Vows within thoſe Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſfers in the Glorious Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh. The Abbat was a Privy-Counſellor, and, for his Fidelity and Prudence, was one of the Executors to the King his Maſter by his Laſt Will and Teſtament. The Structure of the Abby was left imperfect from the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, who had been very Sumptuous in advancing the Workmanſhip from the Altar to the lower-end of the Quire: From his Death, that ſtately Pile of Building had look'd for ſome to help, and there was none that pitied it. This Abbat, a devout Servant of Chriſt, and of a wakeful Conſcience, conſidered the Office he bore, how he was the Chief who had that Houſe of God in poſſeſſion. Therefore he enlarged the length of the Church at his own Coſt, from the entring in of the Quire, or thereabout, to the Weſt-Gate that looks towards <hi>Tuttle-ſtreet;</hi> and contrived the Lodgings with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49492:25"/>ſtrength and handſomneſs at the South-end, which, after the Change made in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign, received the Dean and his Retinue. But Eternal Fame doth beſt ſhine upon his Memory in the Riſing-Sun, or upon the Eaſtern part. There this Abbat, and <hi>John Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> (the Executor to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh joyned with him) laid out ſuch Sums of Money, as that King had appointed for the Noble Enterring of his own Body and his Queens, with the Stems of their Royal Line, and none other. Theſe two, like men of faithful and large Minds, built the Chappel, next behind the Chappel of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, called by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Name, which nothing can ſurmount for Coſt and Curioſity. There they ſet up his Monument in a Brazen Impalement, which looks like the Work, not of our Moderns, but of <hi>Bezaleel.</hi> Now, though not the Soul, yet the Piety and Liberality of the Abbat to this <hi>Domo,</hi> came into Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> by Tranſmigration; who, in his entrance to that place, found the Church in ſuch decay, that all that paſſed by, and loved the Honour of God's Houſe, ſhook their Heads at the Stones that drop'd down from the Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Therefore that the Ruines of it might be no more a Reproach, this Godly <hi>Jehoiada</hi> took care for the Temple of the Lord to repair it, to <hi>ſet it in his ſtate, and to ſtrengthen it, a Chren.</hi> 4.3. He began at the South-eaſt part, which looked the more deformed with decay, becauſe it coupled with a latter Building. I mean the Chappel of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which was tight and freſh. The North-weſt part alſo, which looks to the great Sanctuary, was far gone in Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations: The great Buttreſſes were almoſt crumbled to Duſt with the Injuries of the Weather; which he re-edified with durable Materials, and beautified with elegant Statues, (among whom Abbat <hi>Iſlip</hi> had a place) ſo that 4500 Pounds were ſpent in a trice upon the Workmanſhip. All this was his own Coſt. Neither would he Impatronize his Name to the Credit of that Work, which ſhould be raiſed up by other men's collatitious Liberality, like <hi>Laonicus</hi> in <hi>Caſtilio</hi> his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Vide quàm liberalis ſit, qui non ſua ſolùm ſed etiam aliena largiatur.</hi> I do not expect that the Sacrilegious of our Times ſhould commend him for disburſing ſo much upon a Building of Sacred Uſe; who either make no difference between Holy and Prophane, or Tender Prophane, and Common Things before the Holy. Never in the days of old was ſo much ſpent in private Buildings: Enough is Erected upon new Foundations in the Skirts of <hi>London,</hi> to make two large and beautiful Cities: Yet we ſuffer all our Cathedrals of egregious Piety, and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Bravery, to run to a general Decay, which is all one as to put hands to their Demoliſhment. What Chriſtians would not tremble to ſee their Rubbiſh riſe up in Judgment againſt them?

The unkindneſs ſo deeply taken was chiefly from hence, that the greateſt part of the Houſe of Commons gave willing Audience to thoſe Zealots, who would admit no buſineſs into Treaty, till they had made their paſſionate Complaints, That Popery was ſuffered to increaſe without Care and Controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, His Majeſty knowing it to be a ſcandalous Untruth, which blemiſhed him in the good Opinion of his People, and the contrary ſo well known at home and abroad, that himſelf with his own Pen had cut the Head of that Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the admiration of all the World. Yet the Clamour being more ſtoutly than wiſely maintain'd by the Undertakers, it reached to this prejudice, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief, that the King bethought him that all their Grievances (and they were many) were as groundleſs as this, and that the Proponents were not to be conſulted with for the Publick Weal, and ſo Diſſolv'd them. Generally the Grave and Moderate Gentry throughout the Realm diſlike thoſe hot Diſtempers, which wrought ſo high in the Houſe of Commons: Yet were not ſatisfied with their abrupt Receſs. Such Phyſick is too Violent for the Body, and naught for the Head. For the Unruly ſhall leſs offend in their Houſe, than when they go home, and exaggerate Reports of Miſgovernment among their Neighbours. And that Monarch ſooths himſelf in Error, that thinks he will cloſe up the Wound of ſuch a Breach with a Lip-Salve of a Proteſtation; or by ſome Declaration that he will Redreſs Grievances by himſelf and by his Judges, without troubling his Lord and Commons. For it is ingrafted into the people, not to account any thing for Reformation, unleſs the Workmen, whom themſelves have choſen, do mend the decays of the great Building.</p>
                  <p n="58">58 It is much that a King of great Experience, and ſo full a Soul did diſcern this no ſooner; at laſt he came to it: And after ſeven years Pauſe, he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to try the good Temper of another Parliament. It was high time for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reſpects. Let not two among many be forgotten. Firſt he lacked Mony, and being ſo profuſe in Gifts, he had lacked ſooner, it the Cuſtom-Houſe had not ſupported the Exchequer. In ten years he had not he Received one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy, a very long time to live like a Shell-Fiſh upon his own Moiſture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any publick Supply; which truly he deſerv'd as much, or above his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. For the Kingdom, ſince his Reign began, was Luxuriant in Gold and Silver far above the ſcant of our Fathers that liv'd before us. Only the King wanted, who bred all the Plenty: <hi>It was dry upon the Fleece only, and there was Dew on all the ground;</hi> Jud. 6.40.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, and far above Mony, the King deſired to cloſe with his people in ſuch a ſtrein of mutual good liking, as might give him high Reputation in all Countries, wherein he did negotiate by his Miniſters. A courſe that hath a long Span of forecaſt in it. For a good Correſpondence with all the Heads of the people, is a Sign of the general Love of the Realm. And a King that is beloved at home, will be dreaded abroad. The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to whom he had ſent often for the Reſtitution of the Palatinat, which they had invaded, was ſo great in its own Opinion, that where they Treated, nothing came from them, but that which was faſtidious and inſolent. As at this time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would deign to grant Peace to the States of the United Provinces, not unleſs upon conditions unſupportable; which were theſe four. Firſt to acknowledge him for their Patron and Protector. Secondly, To recal their Fleets and Merchants out of the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> ſurrendring what they had in either unto him, and to Trade in thoſe Parts no more. Thirdly, To permit the Roman Catholics free uſe of Religion in all their Provinces, with Churches and maintenance. Fourthly, To open the Channel of free Navigation between <hi>Zealand</hi> and <hi>Antworp.</hi> They that would demand no leſs for their Friendſhip, where they had not one Foot of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, were like to vex them with more lofty Bravadoes and Grandiloquence,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49492:26"/>in whoſe Territories their Armies had been moſt proſperous, through breach of Promiſes. Therefore our King was provident to fill himſelf with his juſt dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, like the Praepotent Monarch of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> fortified with the Concord and Affections of his Parliament, that by his Ambaſſadors employ'd to prevent the Fears, the Miſeries and Oppreſſions of War, he might not beg but demand: He might not crave but poſtulate his Childrens Inheritance.</p>

The Parliament began to ſit, whoſe bearing was dutiful to the King, but quick and minatory againſt ſome vile perſons, who had ſpoil'd the people by illegal oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Theſe were Canker-worms, Harpies, Projectors, who between the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord Marqueſs to procure, and the readineſs of the Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> to comply, had obtain'd Patent Commiſſions for latent Knaveries; which Exorbitancies, being countenanc'd in the Court, were grown too ſtrong for any Juſtice but the Parliaments to root them up. There the Appeals of the vexed Subject were heard, more like to Out-cries than Complaints; which fell thick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sir <hi>Gyles Mompeſſon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Michel,</hi> for Fines and Levies raiſed upon Inns and Ale-houſes, Arbitrary impoſitions, and a Preſident dangerous to ſpread even to Shops and Ware-houſes. Others remonſtrated againſt a pack of Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who procured the Monopoly of Gold-thread, which with their ſpinning was palpably corrupted and embaſed. Theſe Gilt Flies were the bolder, becauſe Sir <hi>Edward Villers,</hi> half Brother to the Lord Marqueſs, was in their Indenture of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, though not Named in their Patent. A Gentleman both Religious and true hearted to good ways, who was enſnared by crafty Merchants; and ſo far excus'd, that after ſtrict enquiry, when this Adulterate Ware came to the Teſt, it appear'd that he knew not of the Juggling of the Patentees, who drew on grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances with Threads of Vanity, and Scandal upon the Chief Government with Cords of Iniquity. Together with theſe Vermin (and much more than theſe) the Lord Chancellor was queſtion'd, and without pity to his Excellent Parts) the Caſtle of <hi>Munera</hi> (as I borrow it from Mr. <hi>Spenſer</hi>'s Divine Wit) muſt be quite defaced. Monopolies and Briberies were beaten upon the Anvile every Day, almoſt every Hour. The obnoxious that were brought to the Bar of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, with a multitude that feared to be in as ill condition, ſaw no way for ſafety, but to Poyſon the King with an ill Opinion of the Parliament, that it might eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate into a Nullity. They terrifie the Lord Marqueſs, that the Grants of theſe things, which are now Baſtardized by the Knights and Burgeſſes; nay, by the Lords that envy him, were begotten by his Favour and Credit. That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Vengeance is grazed near to himſelf, which is ſhot at his Brother. That it was time to look about him; for at the opening of that Seſſion it was much Noted, that the King had ſaid before all the Members, <hi>Spare none where you find juſt Cauſe to puniſh.</hi> And if the two Houſes ſhould ſit a year, what good could be expected from them, but two or three Subſidies? That it were leſs danger for the King to gather ſuch a Sum, or greater, by his Prerogative, though it be out of the way; than to wait for the exhibition of a little Mony, which will coſt Diſhonour, and the Ruin of his moſt Loyal and Faithful Servants.</p>

His Majeſties juſt and gracious Prerogative was untouch'd: The Grievances of all that were Wronged with indifferency were Received, which they muſt ſift, or betray the Truſt of their Country which ſent them. The former Parliament was very Tart, if not undutiful; what then? Shall we be fearful to put our hands into cold Water, becauſe we have been Scalded with hot? There's no Colour to quarrel at this general Aſſembly of the Kingdom for Tracing delinquents to their Form: For it is their proper Work. And the King hath very Nobly encourag'd them to it in his Speech that in the firſt day he made before them, nay even proffering to have the blemiſhes of his Government Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them; for his own Words muſt literally bear that meaning, as you well remember them; if I may know my Errors I will Reform them.

But if you aſſiſt to break up this Parliament, being now in purſuit of Juſtice, only to ſave ſome Cormorants, who have devoured that, which muſt be regorged, you will pluck up a Sluce which will over-whelm your ſelf. The King will find it a great diſſervice before one year expire. The Storm will gather, and burſt out into a greater Tempeſt, in all inſequent Meetings. For ſucceeding Parliaments will never be Friends with thoſe, with whom the former fell out. This is Negative Counſel.

The more he founded his Judgment, the deeper it appear'd; ſo that his Worth was Valued at no leſs, than to be taken nearer to be a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor upon all Occaſions. The Parliament wearied with long ſittings, and great pains, was content againſt the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> to take Relaxation, and was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued from the 27 of <hi>March,</hi> to the 18 of <hi>April.</hi> The Marqueſs had an Eye in it upon the Lord Chancellor, to try if time would mitigate the diſpleaſure, which in both Houſes was ſtrong againſt him. But the leiſure of three Weeks multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied a pile of New Suggeſtions againſt him, and nothing was preſaged more certain than his downfal; which came to Ripeneſs on the third of <hi>May.</hi> On that day the Patent of his Office, with the Great Seal, was taken from him; which Seal was deliver'd to Four Commiſſioners, the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Mountagu,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> Lord Steward of the King's Houſhold, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> Lord Chamberlain to the King, and <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Surry;</hi> with whom it reſted till the 10th of <hi>July</hi> following. In the mean time Sir <hi>James Leigh,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the King's-Bench was Commiſſioned to be Speaker in the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Houſe; and Sir <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> Maſter of the Rolls, was Authorized, with certain Judges in equal power with him, to hear, diſpatch, and decree all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Court of <hi>Chancery.</hi>

                  <p n="62">62 The Competitors for the Office of the Great Seal were many; Sir <hi>James Leigh</hi> before mention'd, a Widower, and upon Marriage with a Lady of the <hi>Buckingham</hi> Family; Sir <hi>Henry Hobart</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> Chancellor to the Prince, a Step to the Higher Chancellorſhip, and as fit as any man for his Learning and Integrity; which of theſe it was uncertain, but one of theſe was expected. And verily a fitter Choice could not be made, than out of the pre-eminent Profeſſors of the Common Laws, but that all Kings affect to do ſomewhat which is extraordinary, to ſhew the liberty of their power. The Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was thought upon, a Maſter of Reaſon, and of a great Fortune. For it was remembred upon the Death of Lord Chancellor <hi>Bromly anno</hi> 1587, That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> deſigned a Peer of the Realm for his Succeſſor; <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> whoſe Merit for ſuch a place is favour'd by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was <hi>Juris ſcientiâ, &amp; omni politiori literaturâ ornatiſſimus;</hi> and if his Death much bewailed, had not prevented, the Great Seal had been born before him. But the likelieſt to get up (and I may ſay he had his Foot in the Stirrup) was Sir <hi>Lionel Cranfield,</hi> Married in the kindred that brought Dignity to their Husbands; a man of no vulgar head-piece, yet ſcarce ſprinkled with the Latin Tongue. He was then Maſter of the Court of Wards, and did ſpeak to the Cauſes that were brought before him quaintly and evenly. There ſeemed to be no Let to put him in Poſſeſſion of the great vacant Office, but that the Lord Marqueſs, ſet on by the King, was upon enquiry, how profitable in a juſt way it might be to the Dignitary, and whether certain Branches of Emolument were natural to it, which by the endeavour of no ſmall ones were near to Lopping: Sir <hi>Lionel</hi> beſought the Marqueſs to be ſudden, and to Adviſe upon thoſe things with the Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> a found man and a ready, who did not wont to clap the Shackles of delay upon a buſineſs. He being ſpoken to, to draw up in Writing what he thought of thoſe Caſes, return'd an Anſwer ſpeedily on the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49492:28"/>Tenth of <hi>May,</hi> with the beſt advantage he could foreſee to the promotion of the Maſter of the Wards: Yet it fell out croſs unto him, that the Dean woing for another, utterly beyond expectation ſped for himſelf. The Paper which he ſent to the Marqueſs hath his own Words, as they follow.</p>

                  <p>Now I am credibly inform'd, that the Lord Treaſurer begins to Entitle the King to to the caſual Fines, and the greater Writs; which is a full Moiety of the profits of the place; not ſo much to Enrich the King, as to draw Griſt to his own Mill; and to wind from the Chancellor the donation of the Curſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors places.

Yet <hi>Whitgift</hi> knew not the half that this Man doth in Reference to this Office. The Lord Marqueſs the leſs he look'd for thoſe Words, the more he lik'd them, and Replied extempore; <hi>Sir I am a Suitor for none, but for him that is ſo capable of the Place in your great judgment. Be you ſatisfied then,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>I think I ſhall ſeek no further.</hi> The Lord Marqueſs, impotent to contain his Gladneſs, ſent a blind Meſſage to the Dean immediately, <hi>That the King had a Preferment in the Deck for him.</hi> He nothing aware of what the King had ſpoken in deſign to the Dignity of keeping the Great-Seal, miſtook the Meſſage to be meant of the Biſhopric of <hi>London,</hi> now wanting a ſit Prelate, by the Death of him that was moſt fit while he lived, Dr. <hi>King,</hi> whoſe Soul Heaven received <hi>Mar.</hi> 30.

But that great Maſter of Wiſdom did never repent him, that He had truſted ſuch a Servant ſo far; never gave the leaſt ſign of Diſpleaſure to the day of his Death, that He would Remove him; never tax'd him, that he had gone awry in any thing either as a public or private Perſon. Which good Opinion he kept ſo conſtantly, that after two years Probation in his Office, I find theſe Lines in a Letter which he ſend to the Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to <hi>Madrid, May</hi> 11. 1623. <hi>The King's Grace to me is ſuch, that I profeſs before God I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ill Word, or clouded Aſpect from him, ſince the firſt day I ſerved him in this great Place.</hi> His Majeſty would many times ſpeak of him, that He never met with a better States-man for a clear, and far-reaching Judgment. His Knowledge was a Political Circle, that comprehended all things in it. Bring any Matter unto him, his Reaſon was never ſhallow, nor at Low-Water. He ſtudied Foreign Courts, as much as this at home; and cared not what he paid to expert Miniſters, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or Native, to be acquainted with the Secrets of their Maſters. The beſt, to whom he may be ſimilized herein, is Frier <hi>Paul</hi> the Servite, of whom it is written, When any News were bruited, he ſeldom was miſtaken in his Opinion, whether they were true or falſe; and nothing could be propounded to him, to which he did not ſuddenly give an Anſwer, and with that Solidity, as if he had meditated much upon thoſe Anſwers, which were conceived preſently under the Queſtion.

No Cammel did bear more burden then he did, when he firſt entred to ſit in the Seat of Lord-Keeper, or travel'd further with ſo little Food, and leſs reſt; which he ſuffer'd the better, becauſe he was weary of Eaſe, and loved Labour. For confirmation of it I will anticipate, how he was breath'd (till he was almoſt out of breath with a violent, but ſhort Sickneſs) upon the end of the firſt Term that he appeared in <hi>Chancery.</hi> It was the Term of <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and in the <hi>November</hi> of it the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſate again, in which he attended in the Office of Speaker in the Lords Houſe. With theſe, concur'd a ſpiny and difficult Treaty between our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and the Agents of the <hi>United-Provinces,</hi> for the moſt ſavage Inſolencies committed at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> a Treaty wherein he was the Chief Commiſſioner, and the ſharpeſt againſt thoſe Thieves and Murderers: Which Treaty took up three Afternoons conſtantly in every week, while it continued to hear that Cauſe. In the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> beſide the ordinary Work, ſeveral Cauſes, and of a reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing number, were referred in the preceding Seſſion of Parliament to the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord Keeper, to review the Orders of the Predeceſſor diſplaced. Into this vaſt Sea of Buſineſs he launch'd forth all at once. Hereupon my ſelf, and half an hundred more, have ſeen his Induſtry, that he was compel'd to ſit by Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Court two hours before day, and there to remain till between eight and nine, that the Prince being come to the Lords Houſe, ſent for him to take
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49492:29"/>his Place, there to Propound and Report the Queſtions of that Honourable Houſe, till paſt twelve every day, not ſeldom till paſt one. After a ſhort Repaſt at home, he returned to hear the Cauſes in <hi>Chancery,</hi> which he could not diſpatch in the morning. Or if he did attend at Council in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> he came back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evening, and followed his Employment in <hi>Chancery</hi> till eight at night, and later. Then, on the neck of this, when he came home, he peruſed ſuch Papers as were brought to him by his Secretaries And after that, though far in the night, prepared himſelf for ſo much as concerned him to have in readineſs for the Lords Houſe in the morning. In this overwhelming hurry of Troubles, of ſuch divers ſorts and compoſitions, what time come could he borrow for neceſſary Refreſhment, or the Repoſe of his wearied Body night or day? And as the good King pick'd him out for this Task, becauſe He foreſaw that none would outdo him in Diligence, ſo He prefer'd him to be Great in Place, becauſe He knew he was great in Courage. The Supporters on the Steps of <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Throne were not Sheep, but Lions. The way to be Juſt, is to be Inflexible; the way to be Inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is to be Stout; caſting all thoughts of Fears and Favours under feet. No man by natural complexion could be better engrained for it. I will take it up from one that had no mind to ſay the beſt of him; Mr. <hi>Art. Wil. p.</hi> 196. He was of a comely and ſtately Preſence, and that, animated with a great Mind, made him appear very proud to the vulgar Eye. <hi>Quaedam videntur, &amp; non ſunt:</hi> So far was his Heart from Pride, that he never thought himſelf the finer for the Trappings of Fortune. Yet ſo far from baſeneſs, that he knew the Bench he ſate upon, and would not be made deſpicable in the Eyes of the World, much leſs be brought about to ſerve great Men's turns, and ſtretch the Cauſes of the Court, according to the Contents of their Letters and Meſſages; which were no better, in a rude Phraſe, then to be a Pandar to their Luſt, to let them deflower Juſtice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſame Leaf, ſays <hi>Ar. Wil.</hi> again, The height of his Spirit made him odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them that raiſed him, happily becauſe they could not attain to thoſe Ends by him, which they required of him. The height of his Spirit made him ſpeak freely, and counſel faithfully, and decree juſtly, though that Lord, to whom he had eſpouſed his greateſt Devotion, were concerned in the Oppoſition. Which was rectitude and magnitude of Mind, as <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Brutus</hi> makes <hi>Atticus</hi> decipher <hi>Caeſar, Splendidam miniméque veteratoriam dicendi rationem tenet; voce, motu formâ etiam magnifieâ &amp; generoſâ quodammodò.</hi> His Perſon, his Geſture, his Eloquence, were magnificent and generous; whoſe wont it was to reduce his chief Friends to Reaſon, not craftily and timidly, but with a noble and ſublime Sincerity.</p>

'Twas loudly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, (and the King was aſhamed to have ſo far miſtaken the Perſons) that there were ſucking Horſe-Leeches in great places.

The wiſe King having little prevailed by Monitions and Menaces againſt this fordid Filthineſs, caſt his Liking upon a Man whom He might leaſt ſuſpect for Gripleneſs and Bribery. The likelieſt indeed of all others to ſhake this Viper from his hand, and to be armed with a Breaſt-plate of Integrity againſt the Mammon of Iniquity; for he was far more ready to give, then to take; to oblige, then to be beholding: <hi>Magis illud laborare ut illi quamplurimi debeant,</hi> as <hi>Saluſt</hi> of <hi>Jugurtha.</hi> He was well deſcended, of a fortunate and ancient Lineage, and had made his progreſs to Advancements by Steps of Credit; a good Bridle againſt baſe Deviations.

So I ſhake off this Bar, and return to the Reverend Dean, who was in a Function of Holy Calling next to God.

And it was happy for him, when, five years after, Lime-Hounds were laid cloſe to his foot-ſteps to hunt him, and every corner ſearched to find a little of that Duſt behind his door: Eut it proved a dry ſcent to the Inquiſitors; for, to his Glory and the Shame of his Enemies, it could never appear that the leaſt Bird-lime of Corruption did ſtick to his Fingers.

There is a proud Man that Values his own Worth, or rather no Worth, in an high Eſtimation, and above the common Level of Men like <hi>Julian,</hi> the Renouncer of Chriſt, that put ſcorn upon all Worthies, Heatheniſh as well as Chriſtian, and this Great Idolater Worſhip'd nothing but himſelf.

No man that knew them will deny that to be due to Sir <hi>William Boſwel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edward Palmer.</hi> All of them were of Vertuous Converſation, Grave Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, greatly experienced in the World, Sober, Civil, Uncorrupt; in a Word it was a Ship of <hi>Argonautes;</hi> ſo that I have heard of our Honourable Peerage, and of the worthy Judges then Living not a ſew affirm, that an Houſhold ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently model'd, was one of the moſt evident things that diſcover'd the great Wiſdom of the Maſter. Other things likewiſe in the <hi>Interlunium,</hi> as I may call it, of that Great Office were ſpread abroad by Fame, and very juſtly, which ſerv'd exceedingly to ſweeten the general Opinion. They that could dive fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt into Court ſecrets had found, that it was a preferment that came to hand of it ſelf, neither lured to, nor whiſtled to; never ſued for, never ſought for; but as <hi>Mamertinus</hi> ſaid of the Conſulſhip which <hi>Julian</hi> beſtowed upon him of his own Grace, and proper Motion, <hi>non modo nullum popularium deprecatus ſum, ſed ne te quidem Imperator, quem orare praeclarum, cui preces adbibere pleniſſimum dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis eſt.</hi> 'Tis humane to wonder at ſuch a Fortune, 'twere divelliſh to Envy it.

If a Jearer ſhall caſt in, that no marvel if he paid nothing down to his up-lifter, for he was low in Coffers and Credit, and not worth a Bribe; ſuch a one ſays the ſame Truth that I do to the main, but he Collects it falſely. For the Dean was never Richer in preſent Coin in his Life, than he was at that time, which came to appear upon this Account, that as ſoon as he was warm in this New Honour, e'en within two Months after, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Friend, made the Bargain with him to purchaſe his Grand-Fathers Lands in <hi>Wales,</hi> which were ſlipt aſide by ill Husbandry, for which he disburſedten Thouſand pounds, not much more being to be added to the Seller, which he borrowed; wherein he Explained two things to the World by this one Act, that ſuch Monies as lay by him he gave not for his Office; and thoſe that he laid out, he got not by his Office. This was not his Forecaſt, but the Lords above; who takes care for every Sparrow. He little thought to live upon that pittance in his Old Age. But God provided it, that when the wide Throat of Sacrilege had ſwallowed down more than ever was devoured at one Gulp, when the pleaſant Vine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with all the Fruitful Branches were cut down with the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Hook of an Ordinance, than this little Gourd in <hi>Wales</hi> ſhould ſhadow over the head of our <hi>Jonah.</hi> It was well ſaid of <hi>Plato, That a Prudent Man would lay by ſomewhat in Store to ſupply him;</hi> neither was it ſuperfluous though it did ſurvive him; for, ſays he, <hi>I had rather leave ſomewhat, though to mine Enemy, when I Die; than ſtand in need of my Friends, who may prove no Friends, while I live.</hi>

I am yet in the lingring Seaſon of the Paraſceve, or induction prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, before the Candidate carried the Palm in his hand, wherein he proceeded, as far as the Line of a good Wit would let him run, to gain public Equanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Kings intentions. For he beſought His Majeſty to clog the Grandeur of that place with ſuch Terms and Conditions in his perſon, as might comprize it in a leſs Size, than it was ever before Received by any. All which were his own Invention, and his own ſeeking, as it is ſomewhat detected in the <hi>Cabal. pag.</hi> 56. but more largely drawn out in his own Papers, and offered only to be Engroſs'd in an Act of Council. Firſt, That the King would continue no Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor in that place above three years thenceforth; which ſhould firſt be put in practice in this Mans perſon. Secondly, That he ſhould be admitted in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Probationer</hi> for one year and half; and if it appear'd the Charge of the Office to be above his Abilities, yet doing Juſtice equally to his beſt power, he ſhould be Rewarded with an Arch-Biſhopric, or one of the beſt Biſhoprics at the End of that Term. Thirdly, If upon the expiring of one year and half, it were found that he diſcharged the Truſt to His Majeſties contentment, the Royal Pleaſure ſhould be ſignified to continue him to the Triennial Period. Fourthly, When three years were finiſh'd, to have no further expectance to hold that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but to give it over with a peremptory Reſignation; ſo I may ſay, like <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> the Great, <hi>He carried the Winding Sheet of his Honour before him as a Banner.</hi> Fifthly, He moved earneſtly that the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> might have a Maſter of the Rolls of exact knowledge and judgment to ſit with him, Naming Sir <hi>Robert Heath</hi> the King's Solicitor; but it was hindred by ſome, that would try how he could Walk on ſuch ſlippery Ground, without a Staff to lean upon. Sixthly, He Petitioned for ſome of the principal Judges of the ſeveral Benches, whom he Named, that two at leaſt ſhould always aſſiſt him, ſubmitting himſelf humbly as a young Tree to be kept ſteady with ſuch ſupporters A Prudent way, to have many Sage Heads concur to produce one Act of Wiſdom. To ſay in the contrary, it is beſt to leave the entire matter to one, if he be of ſound Intelligence, is as groſs a Flattery as that of the Orator in the Panegyric to <hi>Maximianus, quid opus erat multitudine, cum ipſe pugnares?</hi> What needed an Army in the Field, when <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> himſelf did Fight? Now ſo many of the Orders forecited as concern'd the Mortality of that Office, and ſet the period of his duration in it, were Mortal Laws, and utterly forgotten; for he continued as he began without interpellation above four years, till he was annihilated by his frown, whoſe favour had Created him. The Complication of thoſe Reſtrictions ſerved only for a Method of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in a due Seaſon, to keep that Dignity low ſhorn in appearance, that it might not be blaſted with the Lightnings of Envy.

It was K. <hi>James</hi> his wont to give like a King; for the moſt part to keep one Act of Liberality warm with the covering of another. A meaner Man then a King could ſay (it is <hi>Pliny lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſt.) beneficia mea tueri nullo modo melius poſſum, quam ut augeam.</hi> He that hath plac'd a benefit well, let him imitate himſelf, and do another; that's the ſure way of obliging. The Biſhopric of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was beſtowed on him by the Royal <hi>Congè d'Elire,</hi> the Largeſt Dioceſs in the Land, becauſe this New Elect had the Largeſt Wiſdom to ſuper-intend ſo great a Circuit. Yet in as much as the Revenue of it was not great, it was well piec'd out with a Grant to hold the Deanery of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> into which he ſhut himſelf faſt, with as ſtrong Bars and Bolts, as the Law could make: Elſe when the Changes began to Ring in the Fifth year after, he had been ſure to be thruſt out of Doors in a ſtorm, when he had moſt need of a Covering. Yet ſome Suitors were ſo importunate to compaſs this Deanery, upon his expected leaving, that he was put to it to plead hard for that <hi>Commenda,</hi> before he carried it. The King was in his Progreſs, and the Lord Marqueſs with him, to whom he writes to preſent his Reaſons to the King, which were, that the Port of the Lord Keeper's Place, though he would ſtrike Sail more than any that preceded him, muſt be maintain'd in ſome convenient manner. Here he was handſomly houſed, which if he quitted, he muſt truſt to the King to provide one for him, as His Majeſty, and his Predeceſſors have ever done to their Chancellors. Here he had ſome Supplies to his Houſe-keeping from the Colledge in Bread and Beer, Corn and Fuel; of which if he ſhould be depriv'd, he muſt be forc'd to call for a Diet, which would coſt the King 1600 l. <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or crave for ſome addition in lieu thereof, out of the King's own means, as all his Foregoers in that Office had done. In that Colledge he needed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no Under-Servants, or Petty-Officers, who were already provided to his Hand. Beſide the Very Name and Countenance thereof would take away all expectation of extraordinary Entertainments. And it was but a ſtep from thence into <hi>Weſtminſterhall,</hi> where his buſineſs lay; and 'twas a Lodging which afforded him marvelous quietneſs to turn over his Papers, and to ſerve the King. He might have added (for it was in the bottom of his Breaſt) he was loath to ſtir from that Seat, where he had the Command of ſuch exquiſite Muſic. A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt laid out in ſuch Remonſtrance was not, nay could not be refus'd by ſo Gracious a Prince; who granted twenty Suits to one that he denied, <hi>Magnarum largitor opum, largitor honorum pronus,</hi> which ſingularly fits King <hi>James,</hi> though <hi>Claudian</hi> made it for <hi>Honorius.</hi> Likewiſe by the Indulgence of his <hi>Commenda</hi> he reſerv'd the Rectory of <hi>Walgrave</hi> to himſelf, a Trifle not worthy to be Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, but his Reaſon is not unworthy to be detected. Take it as he Read this Lecture to me upon it. That in the inſtability of humane things, every man muſt look for a Diſſolution of his Fortunes, as well as for the Diſſolution of his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49492:33"/>Body; the latter, of ſure Things is moſt ſure; the former, of uſual Things is moſt uſual. Common Men are in doubtful Places; great Men in ſlippery Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but Sacrilege, being a Raven that continually croaks over the Church-Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Clergy-men were in moſt obnoxious Places.

Whom I leave to a Day of Account, having an Account to give my ſelf, how Proſperous the Lord-Keeper was in the King's Affections at this time, to whom His Majeſty meaſured out his accumulated Gifts, not by the Buſhel, or by the Coome, but by the Barn-full. It was much he had compacted his own Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch advantage, but it was not all, for, being warm in Favour, he got the Royal Grant for the Advancement of four more, who are worthy to be named. He ſpake and ſped for Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> to be made Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury, who had plowed</hi> (that I may allude to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 1 King. 19.19.) <hi>with twelve yoke of Oxen, and was now with the twelfth, when this Mantle was caſt upon him.</hi> Twelve years he had been Public Reader in Divinity in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and had adorn'd the Place with much Learning, as no Profeſſor in <hi>Europe</hi> did better deſerve to receive the Labourer's Peny at the twelfth Hour of the Day. Beſide, what a Pillar he was in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> is to be read in the Judgment of the <hi>Britain</hi> Divines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted among the public Acts, his Part being the beſt in that Work, and that Work being far the beſt in the Compilements of that Synod. The Biſhopric of <hi>Exon</hi> being alſo then void, it came into the Lord-Keeper's head to gratifie a brace of worthy Divines, if he could attain it, his old Friends, who had been both bred in the Houſe of Wiſdom, with the Lord-Chancellor <hi>Egerton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Carew</hi> who had been his Chaplain, a man of great Reaſon and poliſh'd Eloquence, and Dr. <hi>Dunn</hi> who had been his Secretary, a Laureat Wit; neither was it poſſible that a vulgar Soul ſhould dwell in ſuch promiſing Features. The Succeſs was quickly decided, for theſe two prevailed by the Lord-Keeper's Commendation againſt all Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; the Biſhopric of <hi>Exeter</hi> was conferred upon Dr. <hi>Carew,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Dunn</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in his Deanery of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. The See of St. <hi>David</hi>'s did then want a Biſhop, but not Competitors: The Principal was Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> a Learned Man, and a Lover of Learning. He had faſten'd on the Lord Marqueſs to be his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, whom he had made ſure by great Obſervances. But the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had ſo oppoſed him, and repreſented him with ſuſpicion (in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment improbably grounded) of Unſoundneſs in Religion, that the Lord Marqueſs was at a ſtand, and could not get the Royal Aſſent to that Promotion. His Lordſhip, as his Intimates know, was not wont to let a Suit fall, which he had undertaken; in this he was the ſtiffer, becauſe the Arch-Biſhop's Conteſt in the King's Preſence was ſour and ſupercilious. Therefore he reſolved to play his Game in another hand; and conjures the Lord-Keeper to commend Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> ſtrenuouſly and importunately to the King's good Opinion, to fear no Offence, neither to deſiſt for a little Storm. Accordingly he watch'd when the King's Aſſections were moſt ſtill and paciſicous; and beſought His Majeſty to think conſiderately of his Chaplain the Doctor, who had deſerved well when he was a young Man in his Zeal againſt the Millenary Petition: And for his incorruption
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49492:34"/>in Religion, let his Sermons plead for him in the Royal Hearing, of which no Man could judge better then ſo great a Scholar as His Majeſty.</p>

This Quaternion making ready for their Conſecration, a Calamity fell out, which put them all to their Studies, that they knew not which way to turn.

The Arch-Biſhop, pretending to be a Wood-man, took a Croſs-bow to make a ſhot at a Buck. One of the Keepers did his Office to wind-leſs up the Deer to his ſtand, who too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhot at a fair-headed Buck in the Herd. But his Arrow meeting with a ſmall Bought in the way, was caſt a little from the mark, and by an unhappy Glance, wounded the Keeper in the Arm. It was but a Fleſh-wound, and a ſlight one; yet being under the Cure of an heedleſs Surgeon, the Fellow died of it the next day. The like had never happen'd in our Church, nor in any other in the Perſon of a Biſhop and a Metropolitan, which made work for Learned Men to turn over their Books. Councils, and Canon-Laws, and Proviſo's of Caſuiſts, were ranſack'd, whoſe Reſolutions were unfavourable, and greatly to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Fact. It was clear in our Common-Law, that his Perſonal Eſtate was forfeited to the King, though it were <hi>Homicidium involuntarium.</hi> But he was quickly comforted, that he ſhould not Suffer in that: For, upon the firſt Tidings, His Majeſty, who had the Bowels of a Lamb, cenſured the Miſchance with theſe words of melting Clemency, <hi>That an Angel might have miſcarried in that ſort.</hi> The Arch-Biſhop was an happy man in this Unhappineſs, that many Hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled with him; and many precious Stones were in the Breaſt-Plate which he wore, that Pleaded for him. He was Painful, Stout, Severe againſt bad Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of a Grave and a Voluble Eloquence, very Hoſpital, Fervent againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and no leſs againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> (which in thoſe days was very Popular) he had built and endowed a beautiful Eleemoſynary Manſion at <hi>Guilford,</hi> where he was born; he ſent all the Succors he could ſpare to the Queen of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> the King's only Daughter; was a moſt ſtirring Counſellor for the Defence of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> was very acceptable to the Nobility, and to the People both of this Realm, and of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he had preach'd often 14 years before, when he was in the Train of the Earl of <hi>Dunbar.</hi> All thoſe Flowers in his Garland were conſidered ſeverally and mixtly, when this gloomy day of Misfortune bedarken'd him. And you may be ſure our Sovereign Lord thought it the more Pardonable, becauſe it was an Hunting Caſualty, and was very Humane to thoſe Harms beyond prevention, which fell out in that Sport wherein he greatly delighted. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majeſty Reſolved, and gave it him in a Conſolatory Letter under his Hand, <hi>That He would not add Affliction to his Sorrow, nor take one Farthing from his Chattels and Moveables, which were Confiſcated by our Civil Penalties.</hi>

But it coſt more Labour to get out of the Eccleſiaſtical Brias; for many of our beſt adviſed Churchmen took it ſore to heart, and lamented for it, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bitter Tears, for the Scandal which was fallen upon our Church in his Perſon, who in the Eye of General Councils and Canon-Laws was wonderfully Tainted, and made Uncapable to all Sacred Functions performing. Therefore, to come home to the caſe, they ſaid, <hi>God forbid thoſe Hands ſhould Conſecrate Biſhips, and Ordain Prieſts, or Adminiſter the Sacraments of Chriſt, which God, out of his ſecret Judgments, had thus permitted to be embrued in Human Blood.</hi> And ſome of the Prelacy profeſs'd, <hi>If they had fallen into the like miſchance, they would never have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of God's Mercy for the other Life, but from this World they would have retired, and beſoughts His Majeſty for a Penſion to ſupport them in their ſequeſtred Sadneſs, where they might ſpend their Days in Faſting and Prayer.</hi> It was vehemently conſidered, that our Hierarchy was much quarrel'd with and oppoſed by our own Fugitives to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would faſten upon this Scandal, and upon it pretend, againſt our conſtant Succeſſion, (hitherto undemoliſh'd) with all the Malice that Wit could excogitate.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49492:35"/>exerciſe any Eccleſiaſtical Act of Order, or Juriſdiction. His Majeſty, upon the eruption of theſe Scruples, was called up to think ſeriouſly, that his Sweetneſs and Compaſſion did not leave a Slur upon this Church, which himſelf, under Chriſt, had made ſo Glorious. It belonged to the four Biſhops Elect to be moſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in this matter, expecting their Conſecration ſhortly, and to be informed, whether they ſhould acknowledge that the Power of an Arch-Biſhop was Integral and Unblemiſh'd in a caſual Homicide, and ſubmit to have his Hands laid upon their Heads. Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> ſhewed Reaſon, <hi>That it behoved him not to be ſeen in the Oppoſition, becauſe the Arch-Biſhop had Preſented him to the rich Parſonage of</hi> Cotnam, <hi>not far from</hi> Cambridge. It was well taken, for among honeſt <hi>Pagans</hi> a Beneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary would not contend againſt his Patron. Howſoever ſuch as knew not the wherefore, were the more benevolous to the Arch-Biſhop's miſfortune, becauſe ſo great a Clerk ſtood off, and meddled not. The <hi>Rhodian</hi>'s Anſwer in <hi>Plutarch</hi> was not forgotten, who was baited by his Accuſers all the while that the Judge ſaid nothing: <q>I am not the worſe for their Clamours,</q> (ſays the Defendant) <q>but my Cauſe is the better that the Judge holds his peace; <hi>Non refert quid illi loquantur, ſed quid ille taceat.</hi>

L.</hi> is quite miſtaken, <hi>pag.</hi> 71. of his Hiſtory: 'It is true, the Arch-Biſhop, <hi>an.</hi> 1627. was Commanded from his Palaces of <hi>Lambeth</hi> and <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſent to a Mooriſh Houſe in <hi>Kent</hi> called <hi>Foord,</hi> but not, as he conceives it, that the Impulſive of it was the ſuppoſed Irregularity, which was then reviv'd, but becauſe he would not Licence a Sermon of Dr. <hi>Sibthorp</hi>'s, which the King ſent to him by Mr. <hi>W. Murry</hi> of the Bed-chamber, for his Hand to the Printing, which he denied, ſaying, <hi>There was ſome Doctrine in the Sermon which was contrary to his Judgment.</hi> I write (I confeſs) by hear-ſay; but I heard it from his own mouth, and have it in a Manuſcript under his own Hand. It had been a wild thing to rake up the Irregularity again out of the Embers, ſince in the interim he had Conſecrated many Prelates; nay ſince he had Conſecrated the Elements of Chriſt's Supper at the King's Coronation, and ſet the Crown upon His Majeſties Head. And not long after he returned from <hi>Foord</hi> to a Parliament Summon'd to begin <hi>March</hi> 17. 1627. he Conſecrated that Learned Divine Mr. <hi>Richard Montagu,</hi> Promoted to the See of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> at <hi>Croydon, Aug.</hi> 24. 1628. Yet that great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar had Preſented his ſtudied Papers for the Irregularity to the Lord-Keeper more then any man. But now he was ſatisfied to be Conſecrated by the whilom Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſuppoſed. And at the ſame time Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> was Aſſiſtant with the Arch-Biſhop to impoſe Hands. Such Changes there are in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Judgments.</p>
                  <p n="80">80. Perhaps I may be thought Irregular my ſelf, that I have knit the Election and Conſecration of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to the long Series, and Diſcuſſion of this famous Caſe I crave Pardon, if I want one. Now I ſtep back to the Lord-Keeper, who before the end of <hi>June</hi> was a Keeper of more then he deſired, the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> one of his deareſt Friends on Earth, being committed a Priſoner to his Cuſtody. A worthy Lord, and of a gallant Freedom, yet ſuch as leſs then Kings do not like. In the Seſſion of Parliament, which was then newly ended, he was interpreted to exceed in ſome words againſt the Royal Prerogative,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49492:36"/>a Stone of Offence that lay in many men's ways. Beſide he had Rebuk'd the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with ſome Paſſion and Acrimony for ſpeaking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the ſame thing in the Houſe, and out of Order. Therefore he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; but with as much Gentleneſs as could be deviſed, rather to a Nurſe, then a Jaylor. But the Lord-Keeper, though he lik'd his Gueſt, yet he preferred his Liberty before that Liking, and never gave over till he had got his Enlargement, diſcharged him from the Attendance of Sir <hi>William Parkhuſt,</hi> (who, as a Spy, was ſent to wait upon him at <hi>Tichfield</hi>) that he might be leſt only to the Cuſtody of his own good Angel, as he writes, <hi>Cabal, p.</hi> 59. Likewiſe, in Tenderneſs to the Earl's Wealth and Honour, he kept him from an Information in <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> which was threatned; and buoy'd him up at laſt to the King's Favour, ſo as he might rather expect new Additions, then ſuſpect the leaſt Diminution from his Gracious Majeſty. Though all this came purely from his Love and Induſtry; yet of all that was obtained, he would take nothing to himſelf, but directed the Earl to caſt his Eye upon my Lord of <hi>Buckingham, Of whoſe extraordinary Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>your Lordſhip and my ſelf are remarkabe Reflections, the one of his Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in forgetting Wrongs, the other of his Forwardneſs in conſerring Court ſies.</hi> Theſe Paſſages occur in the Printed Bundle. But there is a Letter, the Publiſher of the former did not meet with it, dated two days before, <hi>Jul.</hi> 19. written to the Lord Marqueſs, in behalf of that Honourable Earl, and likewiſe of Mr. <hi>J. Selden,</hi> (my great Friend while he lived) who was clap'd up at the ſame time, becauſe being a Member of the Houſe of Commons in that Parliament, he had preferred the danger of telling Truth, before the ſafety of Silence. Thus for them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he Solicites.</p>

Though not in order of Time, yet in likeneſs of Condition the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Caſe is to be ranked in the ſame File. It was in <hi>April</hi> in the year following that he was ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> betrayed by a falſe Brother for raſh Words, which heat of Wine caſt up at a merry meeting. His Lordſhip's Enemies were great and many, whom he had provoked; yet after he had acquainted the Lord-Keeper with the long Sadneſs of his Reſtraint in a large Letter, (which is preſerved) he wrought the Earl's Peace and Releaſment, conducted him to the King's Chamber to ſpend an hour in Conference with His Majeſty, from whence a good Liking was begot on both ſides. Whom thereupon that Earl took for his truſty, and wiſeſt Friend, uſing his Counſel principally how to Husband his Eſtate, and how to employ his Perſon in ſome Honourable Service at Sea, that the Disſoluteneſs of his Hangers-on in the City might not ſink him at Land. The Lord-Keeper did as much for the Earl of <hi>Somerſet</hi> in <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-time before, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by his mediation out of the Houſe of Sorrow, wherein he had continued above five years, that he might take freſh Air, and enjoy the comfort of a free Life; which was affected by him to gratiſie the ſplendid and ſpreading Family of the <hi>Howards.</hi> And they were all well pleaſed with him, as were the greateſt part of the Grandees, except the Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> for a Diſtaſt taken, of which the Lord-Keeper need not be aſhamed.</p>
                  <p n="82">82. Within Six Weeks after he was ſettled in that Office, the Earls Secretary brought two Patents to be Sealed, the one to beſtow a Penſion of 2000 l. <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> upon his Lord out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which was low mow'n, and not ſit to bear ſuch a Crop; beſide the Parliament, which was to meet again in the Winter, could not chooſe but take Notice, what over-bountiful Iſſues were made out of the Royal Revenue to a Lord, that was the beſt Landed of all his Peers. Yet the Seal was put to, with a dry aſſent, becauſe there was no ſtopping of a Free River. With this Patent came another, to confer the Honour of the Great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>England</hi> upon the ſame Noble Perſonage. The Contents of it had ſcarce any Limits of Power, much exceeding the ſtreit Boundaries of Law and Cuſtom. The Lord Keeper ſearching into the Precedents of former Patents, when the ſame Honour was conſer'd, found a great inequality, and doubted for good Cauſe, that this was a device to lay his unfitneſs for his great place Naked to the World, if he ſwallowed this Pill. But nothing tended more to the praiſe of his great Judgment with His Majeſty. He writes to my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to acquaint the King, that he thought His Majeſty intended to give to greater Power, than the Lords Commiſſioners had, who diſpatch'd Affairs belonging to that Office joyntly before him; and that all Patents refer to the Copy of the immediate
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49492:37"/>Predeceſſors, who were the Earls of <hi>Eſſex, Shrewsbury,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Somerſet;</hi> but my Lord leap'd them over, and claim'd as much as the <hi>Howards</hi> and <hi>Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bries,</hi> Dukes of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> did hold, which will enlarge his Authority beyond the former by many Dimenſions. There is much more than this in the Cabal of Letters <hi>p.</hi> 63. And much more than I meet there in his own private Papers. The King was much ſatisfied with the Prudence and Courage of the Man, that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſplay theſe Errors, than commit them for fear of a mighty Frown; ſo the Earls Counſel were appointed to attend the Lord Keeper, who joyning their hands together examin'd the Obliquities of the Patent, and alter'd them. What would have follow'd if it had paſs'd entire in the firſt Draught? For being ſo much corrected and Caſtrated, yet the proceedings of the Court of Honour were a Grievance to the People <hi>not to be ſupported:</hi> The Decrees of it were moſt uncertain, moſt Arbitrary, moſt Imperious: Nor was there any Seat of Judgment in the Land wherein Juſtice was brought a bed with ſuch hard Labour: Now I invite the Reader, if he pleaſe to turn to the 139 <hi>pag.</hi> of Sir <hi>An.

For the New Lord Keeper walk'd ſo Circumſpectly, that he ſeem'd to fear an Ambuſh from every Grant that was to paſs for the uſe of encroaching Courtiers; if any thing were Ambiguous or Dangerous he was not aſham'd to call for Counſel: If any thing were preſt againſt Rule he was inexorable. <gap reason="foreign">

It were too much to expect at my bands, a Man bred in other Studies, that readineſs or quickneſs of diſpatch, which was effected by them Lords, both of them brought up in the King's Courts, and not in the King's Chappel. My Comfort is this, That Arriving here as a Stranger, I may ſay as</hi> Archimedes <hi>did, when he found theſe Geometrical Lines and Angles, drawn every where in the Sands of AEgypt,</hi> Video veſtigia humana, <hi>I ſee in this Court the Footſteps of Wiſe Men, many Excellent Rules and Orders for the managing the ſame, the which, though I might want Learning and Knowledg to invent, (if they were not thus offer'd to my hands) yet I hope I ſhall not want the Honeſty to Act and put in Execution. Theſe Rules I will preciſely follow, without the leaſt deſlexion at all, until Experience ſhall Teach me better. Every thing by the Courſe of Nature hath a certain and regular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Firſt, <hi>I will never make any Decree, That ſhall Croſs the Grounds of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Statute Laws, for I hold by my Place the Cuſtody not of mine own, but of the King's Conſcience; and it were moſt abſurd to let the King's Conſcience be at Enmity and Oppoſition with his Laws and Statutes. This Court (as I conceive it) may be often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd to open and confirm, but never to thwart, and oppoſe the Grounds of the Laws. I will therefore omit no Pains of mine own, nor Conference with the Learned Judges, to furniſh my ſelf with competency of Knowledg, to keep my Reſolution in this Point Firm and Inviolable.</hi> Secondly, <hi>I ſhall never give a willing Ear to any Motion made at this Bar, which ſhall not apparently tend to further and hasten the bearing of the Cauſe. The very word Motion, derived a</hi> movendo <hi>to move, doth teach us that the hearing is,</hi> Finis perfectio, &amp; terminus ad quem, <hi>the End, Perfection, and proper Home as it were of the matter propounded. If a Counſellor therefore will needs endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as</hi> Velleius <hi>Writes of the</hi> Gracchi, Optimo ingenio peſſime uti, <hi>to make that bad Uſe of a good Wit, as to juſtle a Cauſe out of the King's High-way, which I hold in this Court to be Bill, Anſwer, Replication, Rejoynder, Examination and Hearing, I will ever Regard it as a Wild Gooſe Chaſe, and not a Learned Motion. The further a Man Runs out of his Way, the further he is from home, the End of his Journy, as</hi> Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca <hi>ſpeaks; ſo the more a Man Tattles beſide theſe Points, the further it is from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Motion: Such a Motion is a Motion</hi> Per Antiphraſin, ut mons a non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendo. <hi>It tends to nothing but</hi> certamen ingenii, <hi>a Combat of Wit, which is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and Endleſs. For when it once comes to that paſs, ſome will ſooner a great deal, looſe the Cauſe then the laſt Word.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>I would have no Man to conceive that I come to this Place to overthrow, without ſpecial Motives, the Orders and Decrees of my Predeceſſors. I would be loth to ſucceed any man, as</hi> Metellus <hi>did</hi> Caius Verres, Cuius omnia erant ejuſmodi ut totam Verris Praeturam retexere videretur. <hi>Whoſe Carriage, ſaith</hi> Tully, <hi>was a meer</hi> Penclopes <hi>Web, and untwiſting of all the Acts of</hi> Verres'<hi>s Pretorſhip.

For one Reference that Spurs on a Cauſe, there are ten that bridle it in, and hold it from hearing. This is that which</hi> Bias <hi>calls the backward forwarding of a Cauſe; for as the Hiſtorian ſpeaks,</hi> Quod procedere non poteſt recedit. Fifthly, <hi>I profeſs before hand, this Court ſhall be no Sanctuary for Undiſcreet and Deſperate Sureties. It is a Ground of the Common Law, That a man ſhall make no Advantage of his own Follies and Laches. When the Mony is to be borrowed, the Surety is the firſt in the Intention, and therefore, if it be not paid, let him a God's Name be the firſt in Execution.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>I will follow the Rules of this Court in all Circumſtances, as near as I can.

He would not excuſe himſelf a day, for any the moſt lawful pretence; he would not impart himſelf to the Star-Chamber or Parliament, when it ſate, before he had ſpent two hours, or more, among the Pleaders. Two or three Afternoons he Allotted every Week to hear Peremptories. By which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall'd diligence, commonly he diſpatch'd five or ſix Cauſes in a morning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality, or meaſure of the Points that came to be debated.

There is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Rub in the way ſometimes, Court Meſſages, and Potentates Letters; for, alaſs, in many Cauſes there are great Betters that are no Gameſters. But he had a Spell againſt that Inchantment; an invincible Courage againſt Enmity and Envy. I will truly Tranſlate <hi>Mamertinus</hi> his Qualities upon him, of which he boaſted in the Panegyric for his Conſulſhip, <hi>Animi magm adverſus pecuniam, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri adverſus offenſas, conſtantis adverſus invidiam.</hi> Thoſe Magnificoes, that were Undertakers for perdue Cauſes, gave him over quickly for a ſtubborn Man, that would go his own Pace, and make no Halt for their ſakes, that ſate in the Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of great ones above him. As <hi>Cicarella</hi> ſays of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> in his Addition to <hi>Platina, In ore omnium erat, nunc tempus Sixti eſt,</hi> it is not as it was, theſe are Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi>'s days: No Man now can work a Reprieve for a Malefactor.

It askt him a little time to Learn, as it were, the uſe of the Compaſs, how to Sail into the Vaſt Ocean ef Pleadings, and not to creep always by the Shore: To follow the Pleaders in their own method, and to ſpeak to them in their own Dialect, nay to reduce them from ſtarting out, and to Rectifie every Sprain and Diſlocation.

Yet one of the Bar thought to put a Trick upon his Freſh-man-ſhip, and trouled out a Motion cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med like a Granada with obſolete Words, Coins of far fetch'd Antiquity; which had been long diſus'd, worſe then Sir <hi>Thomas Mores Averia de Wethernham</hi> among the Maſters of <hi>Paris.</hi> In theſe miſty and recondit Phraſes, he thought to leave the New Judge feeling after him in the Dark, and to make him bluſh, that he

To proceed; his Judgment could not be dazzled with Dark and Exotic Words; they were proper to the matters in Hand. The difficulty that he did moſt contend with, was againſt Intrigues, and immethodical Pleadings; ſo that he had much to do to force the Councel to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up their Diſcourſes more cloſely, and to hold them to the Point in Hand, checking Excurſions and impertinent Ramblings with the Rebuke of Authority, though it ſeem'd a little Brackiſh to ſome Palates. With a little Experience he gather'd up ſuch Ripeneſs of Judgment, and ſo ſharp-ſighted a knowledg, that upon the opening of a Bill, he could readily direct the Pleaders, to that which was the Iſſue between the Plaintiff, and Defendant, and conſtrein them to ſpeak to nothing, but the very Weight of the Cauſe, from the Reſolution whereof the whole buſineſs did attend it's diſpatch: So true it is which <hi>Nepos</hi> delivers in the Life of <hi>Atticus, Facile exiſtimari poteſt Prudentiam eſſe quandam Divinati nem.</hi> Prudence is a kind of Divination; let it Taſt a little, and it can gueſs at all.

On the Judges part it is not Patience but Weakneſs, not to abridge Prolixity of Words, that he may come the ſooner to the Truth. And on the Advocates part 'tis Affectation, to ſeem more careful of his cauſe then he is, when he ſpeaks more then he needs.

At this time I find in ſafe Records, how adviſedly he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried himſelf in the Houſe of Peers, upon the ſtarting of two particulars. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of the Nobility was diſcuſs'd, and ready to be determin'd finally by the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49492:40"/>more Active part, that they ſhould take no Oath, ſave only by their Honour; which through his Interceſſion was laid aſide for theſe Reaſons. That the Word of God allows of no Swearing for the finding out of Truths and deciding of Controverſies, but by an Invocation of the Name of God: <hi>Quod confirmatur, per cortius confirmatur;</hi> and it is God's Glory that his Name, and no other, ſhould be accounted more certain then any thing in the World. In all Controverſies, the laſt Appeal is to him, and to none beſide, becauſe there is none above him. The laſt Appeal is ever to the higheſt; therefore we make no further Inquiſition for Truth; after our furtheſt provocation to the Lord in Heaven. In Aſſertory Oaths we Swear, That thereby we may put an End to contentious Cauſes: And it is not Man's, but God's Honour to end them, who is the God of Peace, and that maketh men to be of one mind. Moreover our beſt conſulting Divines col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that the Ground of an Oath builds upon his holy Name, becauſe He is moſt True, and cannot Deceive; likewiſe becauſe he is Omniſcient, and cannot be ignorant; and therefore to be the only due Witneſs for all contentious matters, where there is no other Witneſs. The Honour of the Peerage is a very Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prerogative; but a Creature to Swear, is to put our Soul upon a Religious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And ſhall a Creature be the Object of Religious Worſhip? God forbid: ſhall a Creature be brought in as the Witneſs of all Truth? Or ſhall it be Raiſed up as the Judge which avengeth all falſehood? There is none but God that is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to all Truth: And Vengeance belongs to none but him, that can caſt both Body and Soul into Everlaſting Fire. He added, that ſingularities are ever to be ſuſpected; and challeng'd any man to ſhew the contrary, that no other Oath, but <hi>In the Name of God</hi> was uſed in Solemn Tryals, at that day, in any part of Chriſtendom. And he bad them look to themſelves at home, how prejudicial it would prove to all Courts of Juſtice; and how unwillingly the Gentry and lower condition'd people of the Land would be brought unto it: How loth they would be to refer their Free-hold, their <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> to the proteſtation of Honour; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. If it be ſtood upon, that in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Criminal Cauſes of Life and Death, their Lordſhips vouched their Honour only to Guilty or not Guilty, it might receive this Satisfaction. If a Peer be produced as a Witneſs againſt another Peer before the Lord High Steward, he lays his hand upon the Book, and takes his Oath. No man can be caſt by the depoſition of a Witneſs that is not Sworn. But when the Peers bring their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict into the ſame Court againſt a Peer, they lay not their Hand upon the Book, but upon their Breaſt; which is a Sign that their vouchment by their Honour in that Tryal is not an Oath. Indeed it is not. For their Lordſhips utter it not <hi>Via juramenti,</hi> but <hi>Via Comparationis</hi> That is, they do not Swear by their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but pronounce comparatively that as ſure as they are Honourable, they find the Priſoner Guilty or not Guilty. Like to that frequent expreſſion in Scripture, <hi>As thy Soul Liveth, it is thus and thus.</hi> The living Soul comes not in as an Oath, but as a Compariſon. As who ſhould ſay, <hi>As ſure as your Soul lives, or as ſure as</hi> Pharaoh <hi>lives, I affirm the Truth.</hi> Thus far he contended, and to general Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. It was much that in his Novitiatſhip in that houſe, he durſt contradict ſuch mighty ones in ſo tender a Cauſe. But a Wiſe man commends the Wiſeſt of Heathen men, <hi>Socrates</hi> for that Gallant Freedom; 1 <hi>Tuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the queſtion being canvas'd throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Oaths, an Aged Biſhop, very infirm in health excus'd himſelf, if he could not ſtay ſo long; whereupon ſome Lords, who bore a grudge to that Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Order, cried out, they might all go home if they would; and not contented with that Vilipendency, grew higher in their demand, and would have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againſt the Prelates inſerted in their Journal Book. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> preſs'd it more paſſionately then the reſt; who wanted Theological Advice about the ſtrict Obligation of Oaths, as much as any Chriſtian, which appear'd by his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and Practice about twenty years after. But nothing would now quiet his eager Spirit, but to put it to the queſtion, whether the Lordſhips were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to open their Doors wide, and to let all the Biſhops out, if they would. The Lord Keeper Replied with a prudent Animoſity, <q>That, if he were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, he would put it to the Queſtion, but to the King, and not to the Houſe of Peers. For their Lordſhips, as well Spiritual as Temporal, were call'd by the King's Writ to ſit and abide there, till the ſame Power diſſolv'd them,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49492:41"/>And for my Lords Temporal, they had no Power to Licenſe themſelves, much leſs to Authorize others to depart from the Parliament.</q> With which Words of irrefragable Wiſdom, that Spirit was conjur'd down, as ſoon as it was rais'd. But when the Houſe was ſwept, and made clean, it returned again in our diſmal Days, with ſeven other Spirits worſe than it ſelf. The Motion was then in the Infancy, and we heard no more of it, till it was grown to be a Giant, and diſpoſſeſſed our Reverend Fathers of their ancient Poſſeſſion, and Primigenious Right by Club-Law. Let my Apoſtrophe plead with our Nobles in no Man's Words but <hi>Cicero</hi>'s to <hi>Cataline, In vaſtitate omnium, tuas poſſeſſiones ſacroſanctas futuras putas?</hi> Could your Lordſhips imagine to limit Gun-Powder and Wild-Fire to blow up one half of the Foundation, and to ſpair the other half? When the Pillars of the Church were pluckt down, could the Pillars of the State be ſtrong enough to ſupport the Roof of their own Dignity? They ſhould have thought upon it, when they pill'd the Bark off the Tree, that the Tree would flouriſh no more; but quickly come to that Sentence, Cut it down: Why cumbereth it the Ground?</p>
                  <p n="92">92. Our Forefathers, when they met in Parliament, were wont to auſpicate their great Counſels with ſome remarkable Favour of Priviledge or Liberality conferr'd upon the Church. And becauſe the Prelates and their Clergy were more concern'd than any in the Benefit of the Statutes made; before the Art of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was found out, they were committed to the Cuſtody of their Religious Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Reward of thoſe Patriots was like their Work; and God did ſhew he was in the midſt of them: They began in Piety, they proceeded in Prudence, they acted marvelouſly to the Maintainance of the Publick Weal; and they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in Joy and Concord. But ſince Parliaments, of latter Editions, have gone quite another way, to hearken to Tribunitial Orators that defamed the Miniſtry, to encourage Projectors, that would diſſeize them of their Patrimony, when the Nobles (from whom better was expected) wax'd weary of them, who were Twins born in the ſame Political Adminiſtration: <hi>Samnium in Samnio:</hi> We may look for <hi>England</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and find nothing but New <hi>England.</hi> How are we fallen from our ancient Happineſs? How Diſeaſed are we grown with the Running Gout of Factions? How often have thoſe great Aſſemblies been cut off (unkindly on both ſides) before their Conſultations were mellow, and fit for Digeſtion? <hi>We look for much, and it came to little: Was it not becauſe the Lord did blow it away?</hi> Hag. 1.9. It is not good to be buſie in the Search of Uncertainties that are not pleaſing; yet they that will not trouble themſelves to conſider this Reaſon, may find divers Irritations to Jars in the Cauſes below; but I believe they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them better to the Cauſe of Cauſes from above. From hence came Fierceneſs and Trouble upon this Seſſion, and God ſent evil Angels among them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.49. For the Houſe of Commons ſeem'd to the King to ſtep out of their Way, from the Bills they were preparing, into the Cloſet of his Majeſty's Counſels: which put him to make Anſwer to them in a Stile that became his Soveraignty. The King's Son-in-Law taking upon him the Title of King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Father-in Law's Mind, the Emperor being in lawful Poſſeſſion of that Kingdom, over-run the greateſt part of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with ſome Regiments of Old Soldiers, whereof the moſt were <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> under the Conduct of Marqueſs <hi>Spinola.</hi> Our King received the Injury no leſs than as a deep Wound gaſh'd into his own Body: And all true Engliſh Hearts, which did not ſmell of the Roman Waſh, were greatly provoked with the Indignity. Prince and People were alike affected to maintain the Palſgrave in his Inheritance, but ſeveral Ways. They that are of one Mind, are not always of one Paſſion. The King aſſay'd to ſtop the Fury of the Imperialiſts by Treaty. The Votes of the bigger Number of the Houſe of Commons propounds nothing but War with <hi>Spain;</hi> and this they could not do, but in Civility they muſt firſt break off the Treaty of Marriage, then in Propoſition between the King's deareſt Son, and the Infanta <hi>Maria.</hi> Neither of which pleaſed his Majeſty in the Matter, and but little in the Form, that his Subjects ſhould meddle in thoſe high Points, which he eſteemed no leſs than the Jewels of his Crown, before he had commended them to be malleated upon their Anvil. The Matter, that the Match with the Spaniſh Princeſs ſhould be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more, was diſ-reliſhable, becauſe he eſteemed her Nation, above any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be full of Honour in their Friendſhip, and their Friendſhip very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the enriching of Trade. The Lady her ſelf was highly famed for Virtue, Wiſdom, and Beauty. The Noble Houſe, of which ſhe came, had ever afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fortunate Wives to the Kings of this Land, and gracious with the People. Her
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49492:41"/>Retinue of her own Natives ſhould be ſmall, and her Portion greater than ever was given with a Daughter of <hi>Spain.</hi> And in the League, that ſhould run along with it, the Redintegration of the Prince Elector in the Emperors Favor, whom he had offended, ſhould be included. Therefore his Majeſty wrote thus to the Parliament: <hi>We are ſo far engaged in the Match, that we cannot, in Honour, go back, except the King of</hi> Spain <hi>perform not ſuch things as we expect at his Hands.</hi> Some were not ſatisfied (of which more in a larger Proceſs) that our Prince ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Wiſe of the Pontifician Religion. For as Man's Soul contracts Sin, as ſoon as it toucheth the Body, ſo their ſevere and ſuſpicious Thoughts were as conſident, as if they had been the Luſtre of Prophetick Light, that a Proteſtant could not but be corrupted with a Popiſh Wedlock. Therefore the King took in hand to cure that Melancholy Fit of Superſtitious Fear, with this Paſſage that he ſent in his Meſſage at the ſame time: <hi>If the Match ſhall not prove a Furtherance to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I am not worthy to be your King.</hi> A well-ſpirited Clauſe, and agreeable to Holy Aſſurance, that Truth is more like to win, than loſe. Could the Light of ſuch a Goſpel as we profeſs, be eclips'd with the Interpoſition of a ſingle Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? A faint hearted Soldier coming near in his March, to an Ambuſh una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,

So to ſuch as talk timorouſly, We ſhall fall into the Miſ-perſwaſions of a Catholick Lady, and her Houſhold; It may well be anſwered, Be not diſtruſtful of a good Cauſe, they are fallen among us, and, if God love them, they will joyn with us.</p>
                  <p n="93">93. The other thing in debate ſeem'd very harſh and boiſterous to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that ſundry Leaders in the Houſe of Commons would provoke him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim open War with <hi>Spain.</hi> To which he replied, in a long Letter to the Speaker, That he had ſent ſome Forces to keep the ſtrong Towns of his Son-in-Law from the Imperialiſts. That he had ſent 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to thoſe Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> that promiſed to aſſiſt him, in Jealouſie of their own Territories; and had they done their Part, that handful of Men which he ſent, had ſufficiently done theirs. He told them, that he treated ſedulouſly, at that time, for Peace; but it would be a very Contradiction, at the ſame Inſtant, to be a Party in an open War. And he gravely minded them, that he rather expected Thanks for a long Peace, the great Bleſſing of God, than to ſtir him up to one of the greateſt Plagues, which the Lord threatens to a ſinful Kingdom. That many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, wanton with Eaſe and Plenty, and pamper'd with Reſt, deſired a Change, though they knew not what they would have. But did theſe Words, ſo wiſe and melting, compoſe the Humors of the Paſſionate? No, The Stoicks ſaid well, that from all Words and Actions, there were two Handles to be catch'd hold of, a Good and a Bad. The Virtuous interpret all to the beſt, and lay hold on the Good: The Quarrelſome apply all to the worſt, and lay hold of the Bad.

'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that the Commons in this Parliament voted to give one entire Subſidie to the King, to begin the War. They were not ignorant that five times that Money was not enough to Rig a Navy, and to receive a good Army in it at the Sea-Side. What a poor Stock was this to ſet up ſuch a Trade? a Sign they were neither able nor willing to maintain a War, but at the Tongues end. Finally, The King having deliberated upon this Hurry to Battle, opened the very Oracle of his Heart in this manner to ſome that were near him: <hi>That a King of</hi> England <hi>had no reaſon, but to ſeek always to decline a War, though he carried his Forces abroad; for the Array, or Sword was in his Hand, and the Purſe in the Peoples. His Sword could not fight without their Purſe to maintain it. Suppoſe a Supply were levied to begin the Fray; What Certainty could He have, that He ſhould not want enough to make an honorable End? If he call'd for Subſidies, and did not obtain, he muſt retreat ingloriouſly, to the Wounding of his own Honour, and the Nations. If he were inſtant to have Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and were reſolved never to give over till he had it, after he had craved it, as if he had beg'd an Alms, he muſt take it with ſuch Conditions, as would break the Heart of Majeſty, through Capitulations that ſome Members would make, who deſire to improve the Reputation of their Wiſdom, by retrenching the Dignity of the Crown in Popular Declamations. For 'twas likely they would ask the Change of the Church, of the Laws, of the Court Royal, the Diſplacing of his Officers, the Caſheiring of his Servants. Either at this Rate he muſt buy the Soldiers Pay, or be Scandaliz'd in the Army, to the endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering of a Mutiny, that he would yield nothing to ſave them from Starving, who had jeoparded their Lives for him and his Children.</hi> All this praemiſed, I cannot dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Nature as ſome do, that knew no more than I, to ſay he was no Man of Courage; but out of the Pith of his Arguments, I can collect, he was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of Reaſon.

A number of contentious Squab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he made the Attorney's Pocket up again, which might better be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home by Country Juſtices. It was not meet that the Flower of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſhould be call'd together to determine upon Trifles. Such long Wing'd Hawks were not to be caſt off, to fly after Field-Fares. The Cauſes which he deſigned to hear, were Grave and Weighty, wherein it concern'd ſome to be made Examples for Grievous Defamations, Perjuries, Riots, Extortions, and the like. Upon which Occaſions his Speeches were much heeded, and taken by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Ciphers, which are extent to this day in their Paper Cabinets. To which I Appeal, that they were neither long nor Virulent. For though he had Scope on thoſe Ocaſions to give his Auditors more then a Taſt of his Eloquence, which was clear, ſententious, fraught with Sacred and Moral Alluſions, yet he deteſted nothing more, then to inſult upon the Offendor with girds of Wit. He fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that Inſolencies and Oppreſſions are publick provocations to bury a Court in it's own Shame. And what could exaſperate more, then when an unfortunate man hath run into a Fault, to ſhew him no humane Reſpect? Nay, to make him paſs through the two malignant Signs of the Zodiaque, <hi>Sagitary</hi> and <hi>Scorpio?</hi> That is, to wound him firſt with Arrows of ſharp-pointed Words, and then to Sting him with a Scorpiack cenſure. Indeed, if there be an extreme in ſhewing too much mercy, I cannot Abſolve the Lord Keeper. For many, I confeſs, cenſur'd him for want of deeper cenſures; ſaid he was a Friend to Publicans and

But firſt he never condemn'd an Offender to be Branded, to be Scourg'd, to have his Ears cut. Though that Court hath proceeded to ſuch cenſure, in time old enough to make Preſcription, yet my Lörd <hi>Cook</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſhould be done ſparingly upon this Reaſon, <hi>Quod Arbitrio judicis relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, non facile trahit ad effuſionem Sanguinis.</hi> They that judge by the light of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Wiſdom ſhould ſeldom give their ſentence to ſpill Blood. He would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it; and declin'd it with this plauſible avoidance, as the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> and <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> the Learned <hi>Andrews,</hi> had done before him, that the Canons of Councils had forbidden Biſhops to Act any thing, to the drawing of blood in a judicial Form. Once, I call to mind, he diſpens'd with himſelf; and the manner was pretty. One <hi>Floud</hi> a Railing Libelling Varlet, bred in the Seminaries beyond Seas, had vented Contumelies bitterer then Gall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt many Excellent perſons. Among other paſſages of his Reviling Throat, it was proved againſt him, that he had ſaid, that our Biſhops were no Biſhops, but were Lay-men, and Uſurpers of that Title. <hi>Floud,</hi> ſays the Lord Keeper, <hi>Since I am no Biſhop in your Opinion, I will be no Biſhop to you.</hi> I concur with my Lords (the like I never did before) in your Corporal puniſhment. Secondly in inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pecuniary Mulcts upon him that was found Guilty, he was almoſt never heard but to concur with the ſmalleſt Sum. I would this had been imitated, chiefly by them of the Hierarchy, who managed the judgments of that Court after he retir'd, I would that favour, which was wont never to be denied to any, had not been forgotten, to take away ſuch a part of an Offenders Eſtate by Fine, that ſtill he might have <hi>Honestum Continementum,</hi> an Honeſt Proviſion to live upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Place and Dignity. It was never intended to prune away the Loppings, and to cut down the Trunk too. Nothing could be more harſh to tender Ears and Hearts, then ſuch a Torrent of cenſure as came from <hi>Q.

Thirdly the Lord Keeper's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence was not ſatisfied to ſet the loweſt Fine, but labour'd for as much miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as could be granted, at the end of the Term. The Officers that are yet alive will ſay as much, and make me a true Man, that the Fines of the Court were never ſhorn down ſo near before: And after the Period of his Preſidency, it is too well known how far the Enhancements were ſtretch'd. <hi>But the wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Noſe hringeth forth Blood,</hi> Prov. 30.33. The Lord Treaſurer <hi>Cranfeild,</hi> a good Husband for the Entrates of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> complain'd againſt him to the King, how Delinquents by his Abatements were ſo ſlightly puniſh'd in their Purſe, that the Fees, that came to His Majeſties Enrichment, would not give the Lords a Dinner once a Week, as the Cuſtom had been, nay, hardly once a Term. Behold now a Man that was <hi>Leniſſimus ſine diſpendio Diſciplinae,</hi> as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonius</hi> ſays of <hi>Gratian,</hi> as full of Lenity as could be, ſaving the Correction of evil Manners. But it will be ſaid, he was liberal to ſpare men out of the King's Stock. And no whit leſs, as I will ſhew it, out of his own. Sir <hi>Francis Inglefeild,</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the Fleet, upon a contempt of a Decree in <hi>Chancery,</hi> was much overſeen, not once nor twice, in bitter Words againſt the Lord Keeper, which he vented ſo raſhly, that they were certified home. Well ſays the Lord Keeper, <hi>Let him Bark on, but he ſhall never bite his Chain aſunder, till he ſubmit to mine Order.</hi> But there came a Complaint, by the Information of Sir <hi>J.

But this contumely could not be paſs'd over: There was a neceſſity to purge it, or to fall under it in a public hearing. After time given to Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to make good his Words in

So a Large Fine of many thouſand pounds was inflicted on Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to be paid to the King, and to his Miniſter, whom he had Slander'd. The Lord Keeper in a few days following, ſent for the woful Gentleman, and told him, he would refute his ſoul Aſperſions, and prove upon him, that he ſcorn'd the Pelf of the World, or to exact, or make lucre of any man.

It was his firſt Honour, wherein the King call'd him to ſerve the Crown, being Sworn to ſit at that Board, Three Weeks before he was entruſted with the Great Seal. Many things, and the beſt of his Abilities in that place, I believe, are un-publiſhable; for the moſt of that Work is ſecret, and done behind the Curtain.

He heard often from thoſe whom he had ſurrogated, and appointed in Office to give him Information; and was ſo aſſiduous to enquire after all Occurrences in thoſe many Parochial Towns, that were under his Paſtoral Power, that he would be very angry at the leaſt Slackneſs of his Miniſters, and was us'd to ſay, They might provoke him with Negligence, but never moleſt him with double Diligence; for he could read as much in an Hour, as they would write to him in a Week.

That was ſuch a Bugbear, that at the Motion of it, ſome that were conſcientious, and ſome that ſeem'd ſo, thought that the true Worſhip of God was a Ship-board, and Sailing out of the Realm. True Religion is the Soul of our Soul, and ought to be more tender to us than the Apple of our Eye.

I agree to all this,</hi> ſays the Lord Keeper, <hi>and ſince Your Majeſty will allow both Young and Old to go up into the Pulpit, it is but Juſtice that you ſhew Indulgence to the Young Ones, if they run into Errors before their Wits be ſettled (for every Apprentice is allow'd to mar ſome Work, before he be cunning in the Myſtery of his Trade); and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Old Ones, if ſome of them fall into Dotage, when their Brains grow dry. Will Your Majeſty conceive Diſpleaſure, and not lay it down; if the former ſet your Teeth on edge ſometimes, before they are mellow-wiſe; and if the Doctrine of the latter be touch'd with a Blemiſh, when they begin to be rotten, and to drop from the Tree? This is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Conſideration,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>But what do you drive at? Sir,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Firſt, to beg your Pardon for mine own Boldneſs: Then to remember you that</hi> Knight <hi>is a Beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Boy, from whom Exactneſs of Judgment could not be expected. And that</hi> White <hi>is a decrepit ſpent Man, who had not a Fee-Simple, but a Leaſe of Reaſon, and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd. Both theſe, that have been fooliſh in their ſeveral Extreams of Years, I proſtrate at the Feet of your Princely Clemency.</hi> Which was granted, as ſoon as the Paradox was unridled to pitch upon them. Another Guſt, that blew from the ſame Cape, I mean from the Pulpit, began to be ſo boiſterous, that it came very croſs to his Majeſty's Content. Our Unity among our ſelves was troubled in Point of Doctrine; which was not wont. The Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> having lately determined ſome great Controverſies, awakned the Oppoſition of divers Scholars in our Kingdom, who lay ſtill before. Learned and Unlearned did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to conflict every <hi>Sunday</hi> about God's Eternal Election, Efficacy of Grace in our Converſion, and Perſeverance in it, with much Noiſe, and little Profit to the People. The King, who lov'd not to have theſe Dogmatizers at Variance, us'd all ſpeed to take up the Quarrel early, that our Variances might not reproach us to them that were without. For there was that in him, which Pope <hi>Leo</hi> applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Marcian</hi> the Emperor, <hi>Ep. 70. In Chriſtianiſſimo Principe ſacerdotalis affectus.</hi> He was a mixt Perſon indeed, a King in Civil Power, a Biſhop in Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49492:46"/>Affections. After he had ſtruggled with the Contentious Parties a while, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed like <hi>Moſes, Sirs, ye are Brethren, Acts</hi> 7.26. and that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated not the keen Edge of Diſcord, he commanded Silence to both Sides, or ſuch a Moderation as was next to Silence. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe of the Sublimity of the Points. The moſt of Men and Women are but Children in Knowledge; <hi>and ſtrong Meat belongs to them only that are of full Age,</hi> Hebr. 5.14.

And that at this preſent. young Students, by Reading of late Writers, and ungrounded Divines, do broach Doctrines many times unprofitable, unfound, Seditious and Dangerous, to the Scandal of this Church, and Diſquieting of the State and preſent Government. His Majeſty hath been humbly entreated to ſettle for the preſent, either by Proclamation. Act of Council, or Command, the ſeveral Dioceſans of the Kingdom, theſe Limitations, and Cautions following, untill by a general Convocation, or otherwiſe, ſome more mature Injunctions might be prepared and enacted in that behalf. Firſt, That no Preacher (under the Degree and Calling of a Biſhop, or Dean of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral or Collegiate Church) do take occaſion, by the Expounding of any Text of Scripture whatſoever, to fall into any Diſcourſe or common Place (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than by opening the Coherence and Diviſion of his Text) which ſhall not be comprehended and warranted in Eſſence, Subſtance, Effect, or natural Inference, within ſome one of the Articles of Religion ſet forth 1562; or in ſome one of the Homilies ſet forth by Authority in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not only for a Help to the Non-preaching, but withal, for a Pattern, and a Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (as it were) for the Preaching Miniſters. And for their further Inſtruction for the Performance hereof, that they forthwith read over and peruſe diligently the ſaid Book of Articles, and the two Books of Homilies. Secondly, That no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Vicar, Curate or Lecturer, ſhall Preach any Sermon or Collation upon <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> and Holy Days hereafter in the Afternoon, in any Cathedral or Pariſh Church throughout the Kingdom, but upon ſome Part of the Catechiſm, or ſome Text taken out of the Ten Commandments, or the Lords Prayer (Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons only excepted.) And that thoſe Preachers be moſt encouraged and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, who ſpend this Afternoon's Exerciſe in the Examining of the Children in their Catechiſms, and in the Expounding the ſeveral Heads and Subſtance of the ſame, which is the moſt ancient, and laudable Cuſtom of Teaching in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Thirdly, That no Preacher, of what Title ſoever, under the Degree of a Batchelor of Divinity, at the leaſt, do henceforth preſume to Preach in any Popular Auditory, the deep Points of Predeſtination, Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, or of the Univerſality, Efficacy, Reſiſtibility, or Irreſiſtibility of Gods Grace, but leave thoſe Themes to be handled by Learned Men, and that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and modeſtly, by way of Uſe and Application, rather than by way of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Docttine, as being Points fitter for the Schools and Univerſitles, than for ſimple Auditories. Fourthly, That no Preacher, of what Title or Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever, under the Degree and Calling of a Biſhop, ſhall preſume from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, in any Auditory within this Kingdom, to Declare, Limit, or bound out, by way of poſitive Doctrine, in any Sermon or Lecture, the Power, Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Juriſdiction, Authority, or Duty of Sovereign Princes, or to meddle with Matters of State, and the References between Princes and the People, otherwiſe than as they are Inſtructed and Precedented in the Homily of Obedience, and in the reſt of the Homilies and Articles of Religion, ſet forth (as before is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49492:47"/>by Publick Authority; but rather confine themſelves wholly to thoſe two Heads of Faith and good Life, which are all the Subject of the ancient Sermons and Homilies. Fifthly, That no Preacher, of what Title or Denomination ſoever, ſhall cauſeleſly, and without any Invitation from the Text, fall into any bitter Invectives, and undecent raiſing Speeches or Scoſlings againſt the Perſons of either Papiſts or Puritans; but modeſtly, and gravely, when they are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd thereunto by the Texts of Scripture, free both the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Aſperſions of either Adverſary; eſpecially where the Auditory is ſuſpected to be tainted with the one or the other Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Laſtly, That the Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops of the Kingdom (whom his Majeſty hath juſt Cauſe to blame for former Remiſneſs) be more wary and choice in Licenſing of Preachers, and revoke all Grants made to any Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Official, or Commiſſary to paſs Licenſes in this kind. And that all the Lecturers throughout the Kingdom (a new Body ſevered from the ancient Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>England,</hi> as being neither Parſons, Vicars, nor Curates) be Licenced henceforward in the Court of Faculties only, with a <hi>Fiat</hi> from the Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and a Confirmation under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> And that ſuch as tranſgreſs any one of theſe Directions, be ſuſpended by the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Dioceſs (or in his Default, by the Lord Arch-Biſhop of the Province:) <hi>Ab officio, &amp; beneficio;</hi> for a Year and a Day, untill his Majeſty, by the Advice of the next Convocation, ſhall preſcribe ſome further Puniſhment.</p>

The Scottiſh Brethren were acquainted by common Intercourſe with theſe Directions, that had netled the aggrieved Pulpitarians: And they, ſays Reverend <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> P. 543. accuſe them to be a Diſcharge of Preaching, at leaſt a Confining of Preachers to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Points of Doctrine, which they call <hi>Limiting of the Spirit of God.</hi> But the Wiſer Sort judged them both neceſſary and profitable, conſidering the Indiſcretion of divers of that ſort, who to make Oſtentation of their Learning, or to gain the Applauſe of the Popular, would be medling with Controverſies they ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and with Matters exceeding the Capacity of the People. But what a Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der does ſome make for not ſtinting the Spirit, or Liberty of Prophecying, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers call it? They know not what they ask. Such an indefinite Licence is like the Philoſopher's <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> a monſtrous Paſſive Subject without Form: A <hi>Quid libet,</hi> which is next to nothing. Indeed it is a large Charter to pluck down, and never to build up. Every Man may ſling a Stone where he will, and let it light as Luck carries it. But how can the Houſe of God be built, unleſs the Builders be appointed to ſet up the Frame with Order and Agreement among themſelves, according to the Pattern which was ſhewn in the Mount?

Diſſolve the publick Mint, let every Man Coin what Money he will, and obſerve if ever we can make a Marchandable Payment. Their Confuſion is as like to this, as a Cherry to a Cherry. Give their Spirit as much Scope as they ask: Let them Coin what Doctrine they will with the Minting-Irons of their own Brain. They may pay themſelves with their own Money; but will it paſs with others for Starling? Will it go for current Divinity? To meet them home.

Nay, let thoſe two Writs directed to the Judges, be as diligently peruſed by theſe raſh Cenſurers, as they were by thoſe Grave and Learned Men, to whom his Majeſty referred the Penning of the ſame; and they ſhall find that theſe Papiſts are not otherwiſe out of Priſon, then with their Shackles about their Heels, ſufficient ſureties, and good recognizances to preſent themſelves again at the next Aſſizes.

Their own demeanour, and the ſucceſs of his Majeſties Negotiations are the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that muſt decide the ſame. If the Lay-Papiſts do wax inſolent with this Mercy, inſulting upon the Proteſtants, and Tranſlating this favour from the Perſon to the cauſe, I am verily of Opinion, that his Majeſty will remand them to their former State and Condition, and renew his Writ no more. But if they ſhall uſe theſe Graces modeſtly, by admitting conference with Learned Preachers, demeaning of themſelves Neighbourly and Peaceably, praying for his Majeſty, and the proſperous ſucceſs of his Pious Endeavours, and Relieving him bountifully (which they are as well able to do as any other of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) if he ſhall be forced and conſtrained to take his Sword in Hand: Then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but our Maſter is a Prince, that hath, as one ſaid, <hi>plus humanitatis poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne quam hominis:</hi> And will at that time leave to be merciful, when he leaves to be himſelf. In the the mean while this Argument fetch'd from the Devils Topics, which concludes <hi>a concreto ad abſtractum,</hi> from a favour done to the Engliſh Papiſts, that the King favoureth the Popiſh Religion, is ſuch a Compoſition of Folly and Malice, as is little deſerved by that Gracious Prince, who by Word, Writing, Exerciſe of Religion, Acts of Parliament, late Directions for Catechiſing and Preaching, and all Profeſſions and Endeavours in the World hath demonſtrated himſelf ſo Reſolved a Proteſtant. God by his Holy Spirit open the Eyes of the People, that theſe Airy Repreſentations of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Fancies ſet aſide, they may clearly diſcern and ſee, how by the Goodneſs of God, and the Wiſdom of their King, this Iſland, of all the Countries in <hi>Europe,</hi> is the ſole Neſt of Peace and True Religion. And the Inhabitants thereof, unhappy only in this one thing, that they never look up up to Heaven to give God Thanks for ſo great an Happineſs. Laſtly for mine own Letter to the Judges (which did only declare, not operate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) it was either miſpenned, or much miſ-conſtrued. It recited four kinds of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants only capable of his Majeſties Clemency: Not ſo much to include theſe, as to exclude many other Crimes, bearing among the Papiſts the Name of Recuſanties, as uſing the Function of a Romiſh Prieſt, ſeducing the King's Liege people from the Religion eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Scandalizing and Aſperſing our King, Church, State, or preſent Government.

Yet thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting into the midſt of the Throng to part the Fray, he got a knock himſelf. For becauſe he was principally employ'd by his Office to diſtribute the King's Favours to ſome of the adverſe Sect, he was Traduc'd for a Well-willer to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nay ſo far by a ranting fellow about the Town, that he was near to receive a chief promotion from that Court, no leſs than a Cardinals Hat. At
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49492:49"/>the firſt Bruit of this Rumor the Scandal was told him, and one <hi>Sadler</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor diſcover'd, which he deſpis'd to proſecute, and paſs'd it by with this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 'That the Reporters ſaw the Oar under Water, and thought it was 'Crooked; but he that had it in his hand knew that it was whole and ſtreight. An admirable Similitude to reconcile contraries to a good meaning; for the Eye were not right if the Oar under Water did not ſeem broken to it: And the Judgment were not right, if it had not a contrary Opinion. So the people that are upon the Shore judge one way; for they look upon things beneath the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But States-men judge another, who work at the Oar, or guide the Bark. The Error of the former is tolerable; the Senſe of the other is Magiſterial, and unqueſtionable. So great were this Lord's diſaffections to that corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Church, that he watch'd their Miniſters more narrowly then any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, when they ſhot beyond the Mark of his Majeſties late indulgences. It was ever the unlucky diligence of thoſe, that were Proctors to agitate the Recuſants Cauſe, to importune his Majeſty for thoſe things, which they did not hope to obtain, but the very offer of them with their Arts and Graceleſs Carriage, would make the Council Table odious, contribute much to embitter the Subjects, and to raiſe diviſions. So they dealt now. For they put a Paper into my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s hands to aſſiſt them for the Erection of Titulary Popiſh Praelates in this Kingdom. A moſt Natural ſuperfaetation; with the motion whereof the Lord Marqueſs being amuzed, he ſent to the Lord Keeper for advice, who dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Project with theſe Reaſons enſuing, <q>Firſt it will ſet all the Kingdom on Fire, and make his Majeſty unable to continue thoſe Favours and Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencies to peaceable Recuſants, which he now moſt Graciouſly affords them. Secondly, It takes away from his Majeſty an Hereditary Branch of the Crown, which the Kings of this Land have ever enjoy'd, even before the Conqueſt, and hath never, ſince the days of King <hi>John,</hi> been ſo much as Challeng'd by any Pope, to Wit, the Inveſtitures of Biſhops. Thirdly, It is a far greater miſchief in a State (I mean in regard of the Temporal, but not of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good thereof) then an abſolute Toleration. For a Toleration, as we ſee in <hi>France,</hi> doth ſo divide and diſtinguiſh Towns and Pariſhes, that no place makes above one payment to their Church-men. But this inviſible Conſiſtory ſhall be confuſedly diffuſed over all the Kingdom, that many of the Subjects ſhall to the intolerable exhauſting of the Wealth of the Realm, pay double Tithes, double, Offerings, and double Fees, in regard of their double Conſiſtory. And if <hi>Ireland</hi> be ſo poor, as it is ſuggeſted, I hold, under Correction, that this inviſible Conſiſtory is the principal cauſe of the exhauſting thereof. Fourthly, If the Princes Match ſhould go on, this New Erected Conſiſtory will put the the enſuing Parliament into ſuch a Jealouſie and Suſpition, that it is to be feared that they will ſhew themſelves very untractable upon all propoſitions. Fifthly, For the Pope to place a Biſhop in this Kingdom is againſt the Fundamental Law of the Land, and the King will be held unjuſt and injurious to his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, if to his utmoſt power he ſhould not reſiſt and puniſh.</q> This Draught was brought to the King, who was glad ſuch Pills were prepared to purge away the redundancy of the Catholic Encroachments. And his Majeſty gave Order to him, who had confected them ſo well, to Adminiſter them with his beſt skill to the Spaniſh Embaſſador. That they might work gently with him, the Lord Keeper at his Viſit made ſhew, that he was ſtartled at a heady motion that came from <hi>Savoy,</hi> as he thought, taking no notice of any Spaniſh Agent that had his Finger in it: And beſought his Excellency to ſend for the <hi>Savoyan,</hi> and to wiſh him to throw aſide his Advice for Titulary Biſhops, leaſt it ſhould hinder the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s deſire, in accomodating the Catholics with thoſe Courteſies, which had been granted; which took ſo well with the Spaniſh Embaſſador, his own indiſcretion being not Taxt, but the Folly laid at another Door, that the motion ſunk in the Mud, and was ſeen no more. I will add but one thing, how diſtaſtful it was to him, that the Papiſts ſhould have ſo much as the ſhadow of a governing Church in this Realm taken out of a Letter (<hi>Cabal. pag.</hi> 81.) Written to my Lord of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> being then at <hi>Madrid,</hi> dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. 1623. <q>Doctor <hi>Biſhop,</hi> the New Biſhop of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> is come to <hi>London</hi> privately, and I am much troubled at it, not knowing what to Adviſe his Majeſty, as things ſtand at this preſent.

The Lord Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> Dr. <hi>Harſnet,</hi> a learned Prelate, and a Wiſe Governour (bate him perhaps a little roughneſs) began to proceed in his Conſiſtory, againſt Mr. <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> a Famous Preacher in <hi>Ipſwich;</hi> who Appealed from the Biſhop to the King. And the King committed the Articles exhibited againſt him to be Examined by the Lord Keeper, and by him to be Reported to his Majeſty. The Lord Keeper found Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> to be not altogether blameleſs, but a Man to be won eaſily with fair dealing. So he perſwaded Biſhop <hi>Harſnet</hi> to take his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and to continue him in his Lecture at <hi>Ipſwich.</hi> The Truth is, he found ſo much Candor in Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> ſo much readineſs to ſerve the Church of <hi>England</hi> in its preſent Eſtabliſhment, and made it ſo clearly appear that he had gained di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Beneficed Men to conform (who had ſtumbled at that Straw) that the Lord Keeper could do no leſs then compound the Troubles of ſo Learned and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious a Divine. And I aver it upon the Faith of a good Witneſs, that after this, Biſhop <hi>Harſnet</hi> acknowledged, that he was as uſeful a man to aſſiſt him in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as was in all his Dioceſe. Another Rank for whoſe ſake the Lord Keeper ſuffer'd, were ſcarce an handful, not above three or four in all the wide Biſhoprick of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who did not oppoſe, but by ill Education ſeldom uſed the appointed Ceremonies.

They were ever pick'd out of the beſt Learned, the beſt Qualified, the moſt Cordially affected to our moſt Godly Liturgy, and to the Government of the Prelates. Within theſe Apoſtatizing times, wherein ſo many have departed from them without Cauſe, I cannot remember any of his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but kept their Traces, and to their beſt Power, never run out of the Ring.

Among the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Proteſtants in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> many of them were Braziers by their Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Theſe ſent ſent ſome meſſengers from them with a Petition to his Majeſty, that they might Tranſplant a Colony into <hi>England,</hi> (<hi>London</hi> eſpecially) Men, Wives, Children, and their full Families. Signifying that they would bring with them to the Value of two hundred Thouſand Pounds in Coin, and Materials of their Trade. That their Subſtance and Labour ſhould be ſubject to all Cuſtoms and Taxes for the King's profit. They deſired to live in a Body of their own Nation, and to ſerve Chriſt Jeſus in that Church Diſcipline which they brought with them from <hi>Bohemia.</hi> Though they had inclin'd his Majeſty to admit them, being a great Swarm of People, and bringing Wax and Honey along; yet the Lord Keeper diverted it, from the Example of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> that were ſetled among us. Theſe brought commodious Manufacture into the Realm; but they brought a Diſcipline with it, according to the Allowance of their Patent, which was a Suffocation to the Temperate Criſis of our own Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which Peril of Diſtemper would be increaſed by the Acceſs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemick Congregation.

Yet I have ſomewhat to alledge in the Behalf of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians.</hi> I have in my little Library, a Book printed 1633 (eleven years after the Lord Keeper appear'd againſt their Petition) called <hi>Ratio Diſciplinae, ordiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Eccleſiaſtici in unitate ſratrum Bohemorum.</hi> Their Platform in that Piece comes ſo near to the old Proteſtant Church of <hi>England,</hi> above all the Reformed, that for my part, I wiſh we had had their Company.

How faithfully, and with what Courage, like himſelf, he adventur'd to maintain Orthodox Religion againſt old Corruptions, and new Fanglements, will be a Labour to unfold hereafter. One thing remains that is purely of Epiſcopal Diſcharge, which I will ſalute, and ſo go by it, before I look again upon his Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſive, or Political Tranſactions. When he was Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> he had a Voice in the High Commiſſion Court, and ſo forth when he was in higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. For as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> commends <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> pag. 24. Encom. he was <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, skiiful in all the various Arts of Government. He appear'd but once at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> when that Court ſat, while he was Dean. A ſign that he had no Maw to it. For he would ſay, that the Inſtitution of the Court was good without all Exception; That is, to Impower the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and their Succeſſors by Statute to iſſue out that Authority under the Great Seal, which was annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm, to aſſign ſome, as often, and to ſo long time as the King ſhould think fit, to be Judges for the Reformation of great Abuſes and Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. But that this Power ſhould be committed from the Kings and Queens of this Realm to any Perſon or Perſons, being Natural born Subjects to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, to overlook all Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes, correct, puniſh, deprive, whether one or more, whether Lay or Clergy, whether of the vileſt as well as the nobleſt, nay whether Papiſt as well as Proteſtant, as no harm was to be feared from good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, albeit they have this Liberty by the Tenure of the Act 1 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 1. So if God ſhould give us a <hi>King in his Anger,</hi> who would oppreſs us, till our cry went up like the Smoke out of a Furnace, this Statute would enable them to enact Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs by a Law. This was a Flaw (to his ſeeming) in the Corps of the Statute, which gave Vigour to the High Commiſſion. But in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and her two bleſſed Succeſſors, God be praiſed, we were never the worſe for it. Better Commiſſioners than were appointed in their Days, need not be wiſh'd. What ail'd this wiſe Church-man then to be ſo reſerv'd, and to give ſo little At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in that Court? He was not ſatisfied in two things: Neither in the Multiplicity of Cauſes, that were pluck'd into it, nor in the Severity of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. It is incident to Supream Courts, chiefly when Appeals fly unto them; to be ſick of this Timpany, to ſwell with Cauſes. They defraud the lower Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of their Work and Profit, which comes home to them with Hatred. What a Clamor doth <hi>Spalat.</hi> make, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Eccl.

Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viorum omnium tractus ad ſuam derivat molam, nobis quod ſugamus, nihil relinquitur.</hi> The Affairs of all Eccleſiaſtical Tribunes were little enough to drive that Mill: So the Conſiſtories of all the Suffragans in the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> became in a manner Deſpicable, becauſe the Matters belonging to every Dioceſs were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed before the High Commiſſion.

It ſeems ill Manners increas'd apace: For I heard it from one that liv'd by the Practice of that High Court, <hi>An.</hi> 1635: That whereas in the laſt Year of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift,</hi> eight Cauſes were left to be diſcuſs'd in <hi>Eaſter-Term,</hi> there were no leſs than a Thouſand depending at that time. This was one of his Exceptions, That the High Court drew too much into its Cognizance. The other Reaſon, which made him ſtand a loof from it, was, That it puniſh'd too much. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> was rigorouſly Juſt, which made him ſhew leſs Pity to Delinquents. Sentences of great Correction, or rather of Deſtruction, have their Epocha from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy in that Court. (And after him it mended like ſowre Ale in Summer.) It was not ſo in his Predeceſſor <hi>Bancroft</hi>'s Days, who would Chide ſtoutly, but Cenſure mildly. He conſidered that he ſate there rather as a Father, than a Judge. <hi>Et pro peccato magno paululum ſupplicii ſatis eſt patris.</hi> He knew that a Paſtoral Staff was made to reduce a wandering Sheep, not to knock it down. He look'd upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in whom the Power of the Keys was given to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of all the Officers of the Church, who incurr'd a great Offence in the Hall of the High Prieſt (let the Place be ſomewhat conſider'd, but his Action moſt.) <hi>Ut mitior eſſet delinquentibus grandis delinquens,</hi> Saith St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> It being the moſt indubitate Courſe of that Commiſſion, to deprive a Miniſter of his Spiritual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments; that is, of all he had, if Drunkenneſs, or Incontinency were prov'd againſt him. I have heard the Lord Keeper (who was no Advocate for Sin, but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49492:51"/>for Grace and Compaſſion to Offenders) diſ-reliſh that way, for this Reaſon. That a Rector, or Vicar, had not only an Office in the Church, but a Free-hold for Life by the Common Law, in his Benefice. If a Gentleman, or Citizen had been Convicted upon an Article of Scandal in his Life, was it ever heard that he did Confiſcate a Mannor, or a Tenement? Nay, What Officer in the Rolls, in the Pipe, in the Cuſtom-houſe, was ever diſplac'd for the like? Under St <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Diſcipline, and the Rigor of the Eliberitan Canons, the Lay were obnoxious to Cenſures as much as the Clergy. <hi>But above all</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>there is nothing of Brotherhood, nor of Humanity in this, when we have caſt a Presbyter cut of Doors, and left him no Shelter to cover his Head; that we make no Proviſion for him out of his own for Term of Life, to keep him from the Extremities of Starving or Begging, thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Miſeries.</hi>

Theſe Reaſons prevailing with him, to be no ordinary Frequenter of that Court; yet an Occaſion was offered, which required his Preſence, <hi>Mart.</hi> 30. 1622, which will draw on a Story large and memorable. <hi>M. Amonius de Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> made an Eſcape out of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> an Engliſh Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman being his Conductor, he poſted through <hi>Germany,</hi> and came ſafe into <hi>England</hi> in the end of the Year 1616. The King gave him Princely Welcome: Many of the Religious Peers, and Chief Biſhops, furniſhed him with Gold, that he lack'd for nothing. He ſeem'd then, for all this Plenty brought in, to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous of none of theſe things; but was heard to ſay, That the Proviſion of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miniſter of our Church would ſuffice him. For in the end of <hi>June,</hi> as he was brought on his Way to the Commencement at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> a Worthy and a Bountiful Divine, Dr. <hi>John Mountfort</hi> receiv'd him for a Night in his Parſonage-Houſe of <hi>Anſty.</hi> Where <hi>Spalat.</hi> noting that Dr. <hi>Mountfort</hi> had all things about him orderly and handſome, like a genteel Scholar; he proteſted to all that were in preſence, that if he could obtain ſuch a Houſe to dwell in, and no more than the Profits of ſuch a Pariſh to maintain him, he would go no further in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Things of this Life. But King <hi>James,</hi> no Niggard in Liberality, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to take more than he ask'd; as <hi>Naaman</hi> urged <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who was as willing to receive, as <hi>Naaman</hi> to give, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.23. He was inſtalled Dean of <hi>Windſor,</hi> and admitted Maſter of the <hi>Savoy-Hoſpital</hi> in the <hi>Strand.</hi> Theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were worth to him 800 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> They brought in no leſs, and he would not looſe a Peny of his Due; but ſtudied to exact more, than ever by Cuſtom had been received by any of thoſe Dignitaries. Of which Sharking, his Majeſty once admoniſhed him: Yet his Veins were not full, but he got himſelf preſented by the Church of <hi>Windſor,</hi> to a good Benefice, ſays Mr. <hi>Ri. Montagu, Weſt Ilſly</hi> in <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> where he made a ſhift to read the Articles of 1562 in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, <hi>pro more Clericali,</hi> and ſubſcribed to them. <hi>But</hi> Jeſurum <hi>waxed fat, and kicked, Deut.</hi> 28.15. For toward the end of <hi>January</hi> 1621, he came to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds</hi> to be brought to the King, and with as bold a Fore-head, as ever any Face was dreſt in, he became an humble Suppliant to his Majeſty, that he might have his Leave to return for <hi>Italy.</hi> The Courtiers that ſtood by look'd up to Heaven in wonder: For no Man dreamt of this Inconſtancy, and certainly no Man leſs than the King. He that is not ready to do Evil, is ever flow to ſuſpect Evil of others. But his Majeſty carried it with high Wiſdom: For, as if this Recoiler had told him no News, he ſpake but this little, and diſmiſt him. <hi>If you have a mind to be gone, I will not ſtay you; and at my firſt Leiſure, I will appoint thoſe that ſhall confer with you about your Diſmiſſion.</hi> A brave Contempt, and well beſtow'd upon a Proud Man, that did not expect to be valued at a Triſle, which was not worth the keeping. Many have written before me the reaſon of this Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's retrograde Motion, and likewiſe what it was that bore him up ſo ſtifly, to be very confident, or to ſeem to be, to preſent himſelf before the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave. I ſhall not loſe my Thanks, I hope, If I add my Obſervations, with a little more than hath already been diſcovered. <hi>Firſt,</hi> About the middle of <hi>Autumn, Ann.</hi> 1621, <hi>Ant. de Dominis</hi> beſought the King to confer the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>York</hi> upon him. A haſty Suitor, for the Place was not void. The Error came about thus: The Arch-Biſhop then in being (called familiarly <hi>Toby Matthew</hi>) was ever pleaſant, and full of becoming Merriment; and knowing that his Death had been long expected, was wont every year, once, or oftner, to cauſe Rumours to be raiſed that he was deceaſed. And when he had put this Dodgery ſtrongly upon thoſe at <hi>London,</hi> that gap'd for the Vacancy to ſucceed him, it was a Feaſt of Laughter to him, to hear what Running and Riding there was to fill up his Room, who jear'd them behind the Lattuce.

It was not now as in <hi>Lanfranke</hi> and <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s Days, to make a Stranger a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan of <hi>England.</hi> The Man, impatient that his Requeſt had ſo large a Denial, offers his Departure, as 'tis ſaid before, not diſtruſting, but that the King would bid for ſuch Ware, as much as the Man thought himſelf to be worth. But being over-ſhot, and laid aſide with Scorn, he would have eat his Words, and eaſt out Speeches in oblique before ſome of the Council, that whatſoever he had uttered, he was diſpos'd more to pleaſe the King, than to pleaſe himſelf. But he found no Place for Repentance. And of all this the Lord Keeper is my Author.</p>

The vigilant Men at <hi>Rome</hi> knew better than we in <hi>England,</hi> that the Jade had a mind to ſlip his Halter, and to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, becauſe we did not fill his Rack, and plump him up with Provender. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the beginning of <hi>January, (Hui! tam cito?)</hi> a Packet came to his Hands from Cardinal <hi>Mellino,</hi> whoſe Contents were, <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>the Fifth was dead, from whoſe Anger he had made haſte to be gone, becauſe he had provok'd him in defending the Venetian Quarrel againſt him; but</hi> Gregory <hi>the Fifteenth, of the Ludoviſian Family, was then in the Papal Throne, as propenſe unto him of old as any Friend, and as true to him as his own Brother. That he had ſent him an Apoſtolical Brief to</hi> Bruſſels (<hi>for ſuch Miſſives were not welcomed in</hi> England) <hi>to give him Aſſurance of good Speed at</hi> Rome, <hi>with a plenary Indulgence for all the Provocations of his Writings.</hi> And <hi>Mellino</hi> added (for that muſt not be left out) <hi>That a great Dignity lay in Lavender for him,</hi> Eaque valde opima. <hi>So Dr.</hi> Crakanthorp <hi>cites it from</hi> Spalato<hi>'s own Mouth,</hi> Pretium octuplicis ſtipendii, <hi>eight times more in value than his engliſh Preferments, Defen. Eccl. Angl. c.</hi> 8. <hi>art.</hi> 5. But a Man not half ſo wiſe as <hi>Spalat.</hi> might diſcern, that if he did conſide in this Ludoviſian Pope alone, the Security was very rotten. Every Child preſaged his Life was not long. Death was ready to arreſt him every day upon two Suits, great Age, and great Infirmity. This Renego ſailed from our Ports in the end of <hi>April,</hi> arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> and this Pope, the Hope of his Life and Fortunes, expired <hi>July</hi> 8, <hi>Stilo Novo,</hi> 1623. Neither was he igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this <hi>Gregory</hi>'s approaching Mortality, his own Phyſicians confeſt he was of ſhort Continuunce. <hi>Be that very probable,</hi> ſaid they that undermined him, and plied him with Packets from beyond Seas, <hi>all the better.</hi> For who is the Riſing-Sun? Who is the Prelate upon whom all Eyes are caſt for the certain Succeſſor, but Cardinal <hi>Mellino,</hi> his other Self, the Undertaker for his Indemnity, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement? Certainly he was bewitch'd with that Impoſture, yet an Impoſture that had Truth in it, as well as Cunning. The Conclave how <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth was choſen Pope, <hi>Aug.</hi> 6. 1623, was Printed at <hi>London</hi> by Licenſe, <hi>An.</hi> 1642. Therein is diſcourſed, how Cardinal <hi>Burgeſi,</hi> the leading Prelate of the Conclave, labour'd ſo ſtifly for <hi>Mellino,</hi> that <hi>July</hi> 22, he had fifteen Voices in the Scrutiny, and eleven in the Acceſs, Which filled his Friends with Hopes to get ten Voices more to conſummate the Election. Again, <hi>July</hi> 27, he had moſt Voices both in the Scrutiny and Acceſs: Whereupon Cardinal <hi>Sforza</hi> was ſo tranſported in his own Imagination to advance him, that if <hi>Mellino</hi> might have been created Pope by Adoration (as formerly the Cuſtom would have done it, but was croſt by a new Bull) it had been effected. <hi>Mellino</hi> had a good Courſe for it, though Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Barberino</hi> catcht the Hare, and was as near to the Papacy, and as publickly cry'd up, as Cardinal <hi>Sachetti</hi> in the late Conteſtation of the tedious Conclave, wherein the now inthroned <hi>Alexander</hi> the VII. had much ado to ſtep before him. But <hi>Mellino</hi> loſt the Day and thereupon <hi>Am. de Dominis</hi> his Cake was Dough; who ſet his Reſt upon a Card before it was drawn. Yet that was the leaſt part of his Folly; he remains for an Example of the moſt beſotted Caſt-away that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I read. <hi>Ita ſe res habet, ut plerumque cui fortunam mutaturus eſt Deus, conſilia corrumpat,</hi> ſays <hi>Paterculus.</hi> The Judgment of Blindneſs fell upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> before the Vengeance of Fire. How durſt this bold Bayard look the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Face upon any Terms, whoſe Writings were more copious againſt the Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Papacy, than ever came out of the Preſs? An <hi>Italian</hi> never forgives an Injury. But Indignities written, and with the Pen of a Diamond, againſt the Sublimity Pontifical, are more unpardonable with them, than Blaſphemies againſt Chriſt. Had Cardinal <hi>Mellino,</hi> his Confident, been elected Pope, the Pope would have forgotten all that the Cardinal had promiſed him. What had <hi>Fulgentio</hi> the Servite done, to be compared with his <hi>Scopuli,</hi> and ſuch jerking Books? He had maintained the Venetian juſt Laws againſt <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth's Abrogations; yet ever
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49492:52"/>abode in the Boſom of the Roman Church. He had wrote the Life of Frier <hi>Paul,</hi> whom they hated, to the full pitch of his Praiſe. But what were theſe Toys to the Eccleſiaſtical Republick of <hi>Antonius de Dominis?</hi> Yet after twelve years that <hi>Fulgentio</hi> had provok'd them, he having obtained ſafe Conduct to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fiſher's Ring, and <hi>Berlingerius Geſſius,</hi> the Apoſtolical Nuntio at <hi>Venice,</hi> pawn'd his Faith to the poor Man for his Incolumity; yet he was cited before the Inquiſition, Condemn'd, and Burnt in <hi>Campo di Flora:</hi> And his Aſhes were ſcarce cold, when this daring Wretch came wittingly into the Den of the Lion.</p>

He proteſted he came hither, and returned to the Place from whence he came for the ſame end, to finiſh the Work which <hi>G. Caſſander</hi> began, to compoſe a Method of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, Greeks and Latins; for the Uniting of the Northern and Southern Diſtractions of the Reformed Evangelical Divines, and the Papalins. That this had been his Deſign within his own Breaſt for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; and that his Studies were now come to that Maturity, that he ſaw no Unlikelihood to prevail. But what if the Arch-Biſhopric of <hi>York</hi> had fallen into his Mouth, which he gap'd for? Certainly he would have forgot his Trade of Compoſing Churches, and caſt Anchor upon this Shoar for ever; for his Religion was a Coat that had all Colours, but wanted Argent and Ore. Yet if a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſome ſuch Promotion had ſtopt his way, I do not diſ-believe him, but that he was traverſing in and out to attone the Differences of the moſt principal Chriſtian Sects. So Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> underſtood him, under whoſe Hand I find this Note among his Diary Records. <hi>Accingit ſe aditer Romam Verſus, neſcio quâ ſpe convocandi generalis concilii, &amp; rem religionis componendi.</hi> He was packing for <hi>Rome,</hi> in hopes to ſee a General Council call'd to cure the Diſtractions of Religion.

For all this, ſew believ'd him that he was in earneſt. He that is untrue in many things, is juſtly preſum'd to be bad in all. But I am brought over, by palpable Evidences, to ſuſpect him of ſo much Honeſty, that he followed that good Work, with all the Might of Wit and Labour, to bring the Churches of Chriſt together, which were withdrawn from one another in Hatred and Hoſtility. And it was an eaſie thing to him to ſurmiſe it feaſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was of ſo looſe a Religion. Nay, He thought it was ſo near to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, that it was already as good as done, if both ſides would take prudent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that it was done.

We may communicate with them that hold Tranſubſtantiation, for it deſtroys Nature rather than Grace: it is an Error of a good Mind, not out of Diſhonour to Chriſt, but out of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For Image-worſhip, it is the leaſt thing of an hundred to be paſt over; for as when the Bible lyes before us, and we Pray out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> we do not adore the Bible, no more do they the Crucifix that is plac'd before them.

I will repreſent him in a Line or two, that he was as indifferent, or rather diſſolute in Practice, as in Opinion. For in the ſame <hi>Cap.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though he was poſted up for a Shittle-cock in all Univerſities, and even Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laded by Boys for his Inconſtancy, they were miſtaken: For both Churches to him were one, and when he was in one, he was in both.

Upon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Day, when the Lord <hi>Cranfield</hi> (then Maſter of the Wards, and immediately created Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi>) took his Place as Lord Treaſurer in the Exchequer-Chamber, the Lord Keeper gave him his Oath, and ſaluted his Admiſſion with a ſhort Speech following: <q>My Lord, You are called to ſerve his Majeſty in the Place of a Lord Treaſurer, by the moſt Honourable and moſt Ancient Call in this Realm, the delivery of a Staff, to let you know, that you are now become one of the ſureſt Staffs or Stays that our great Maſter relies upon in all this Kingdom.

For the preſent ſupplying of this want in his Majeſty, I will ſay as the Hiſtorian did of the Election of <hi>Tiberius, Non quaerendus quem eligeret, ſed eligendus qui emineret:</hi> The King was not now to think of one whom he ſhould chooſe, but to chooſe one who was moſt eminent.

Now if it be expected that I ſhould ſay any thing for your Lordſhips Direction in this Great Office, your Lordſhips Wiſdom, and my Ignorance will plead pardon, though I omit it. I will only ſay one word, and that ſhall be the ſame which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaid to one <hi>Maximus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Queſtor, that is, Treaſurer for <hi>Achaia, Memeniſſe oportet Oſſicii titulum;</hi> Remember but your Name, and you ſhall do well enough.

And ſo I wiſh your Lordſhip as much Joy of your Place, as the King and the State do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of your Lordſhip. This was the Perfume which was caſt upon the new Treaſurer in his Robes of Inſtalment.</q> The King was pleaſed much in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement: For his Majeſty had proved him with Queſtions, and found that he was well ſtudied in his Lands, Cuſtoms, in all the Profits of the Crown, in Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Accompts And in the general Opinion the White-Staff was as fit for his Hand, as if it been made for it. The moſt that could be objected was, that he was true to the King, but gripple for himſelf: A good Steward for the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> but ſower and unreliſhing in Diſpatch: A better Treaſurer than a Courtier. There was nothing in appearance but Sun-ſhine and warm Affections between him and the Lord Keeper. The Lord Treaſurer, I know well, had croſs'd the other in one or two Suits which had been beneficial to him, and not drawn a Denier out of the Kings Purſe. He dealt ſo with every Man; therefore the Sufferer gave lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſign of Grievance: It was not his Caſe alone. Another Pick in which they agreed not, (I cannot ſay diſagreed) was about a Brood of Pullein, which were never hatcht. The laſt Parliament being diſſolv'd, it was well thought of by ſome of the Lords of the Council-Board, to ſweeten the ill reliſh, which it had in ſome Palats, with a Pardon of Grace, that might extend to a fair Latitude, for the eaſe of thoſe that were queſtion'd for old Debts and Duties to the Crown, for concealed Wardſhips and not ſuing out Liveries, and ſuch charges of the like kind, which put thoſe that were ſecure in their Improvidence to a great deal of trouble, and diſanimated their beſt Friends, for fear of ſuch blind Claps, to be their Executors. When the Lord Keeper had brought this Pardon ſo near to his Birth, that the Atturney-General was ſent for to draw it up, the Lord Treaſurer mov'd, That ſuch as took out this Pardon ſhould pay their Fees, which are accuſtomed in that kind, to ſuch Officers as he ſhould appoint, that the Advantage might enrich the King, and that himſelf might have that ſhare, which the Lord Chancellour us'd to have, who put the Seal to thoſe Pardons This was heard with a dry laughter, and denied him. But from thenceforth he ſtruggled to correct the luſty Wine of the Pardon with ſo much Water, that there was no comfort in it; and falling ſhort of that Grace which was expected, was debated no more. The Lord Keeper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtein'd a good Report for the Conception of the Pardon, and the Lord Treaſurer a great deal of Envy for the Abortion, it curdled in his Stomach into Choler and Miſchief. And wherefore was he angry with his Brother <hi>Abel?</hi> Look what St. <hi>John</hi> anſwers, 1 <hi>Epiſt. Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12.

They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Cabal, Pag. 72. which the Lord Keeper puts away as quietly, as the Wind blows off the Thiſtle-Down: Puſheth his Adverſary down with his little Finger, yet inſults not upon his Weakneſs. As <hi>Pliny</hi> writes to <hi>Sabin, Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Ep.

Yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by Letters to the Lord Marquiſs, as if he were ſenſible of the deſpite, and unto him was very loud in his own Juſtification. From whom he got no more remedy, but that his Adverſary was not believ'd: And was will'd to conſider that he dealt with one, whoſe ill Manners would not pay him Satisfaction for an Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Unto which the Lord Keeper rejoyn'd to the Lord Marquiſs, <hi>His Majeſties Juſtice and your Lordſhips Love are Anchors ſtrong enough for a Mind more toſt than mine is, to ride at. Yet pardon me, my Noble Lord, upon this Conſideration, if I exceed a little in Paſſion, the Natural Effect of Honeſty and Innocency. A Church-man and a Woman have no greater Idol under Heav'n than their Good Name: And they cannot Fight, nor with Credit Scold, and leaſt of all Recriminate to Protect and Defend the ſame: The only Revenge left them is to grieve and complain.</hi> Then he concludes, <hi>Whom I will either Challenge before his Majeſty to make good his Suggeſtions, or elſe (which I hold the greater Valour, and which I wanted I confeſs before this Check of your Lordſhips) go on in my courſe, and ſcorn all theſe baſe and unworthy Scandals, as your Lordſhip ſhall direct me.</hi> What need more be ſaid? In the ſpace of a Month they wrangled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

The Treaſurer was miſinform'd, or coin'd it out of his own Head, That the Keeper diſpatch'd great Numbers of Cauſes by hearing Petitions in his Chamber, and that he did uſually reverſe Decrees upon Petitions That Forty Thouſand Pounds had been taken in one Year among his Servants by ſuch ſpurious and illegitimate Juſtice.

Every man may judge better of that which he reads, than that which he hears; chiefly, he that is initiated into a Profeſſion. Allow him Cork that learns to Swim, to keep him from Sinking, he ſaves himſelf, and hurts no man. Therefore it was a moſt certain way to overcome ſome part of the Tediouſneſs of Buſineſs by Petitions; and it was no leſs incorrupt, innocent, legal, expedite to do good to the People. Some that practis'd at the Bar, repin'd that they might not have a Glut of Motions: Of whoſe covetous Diſcontents, this Lord was aware; as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays of <hi>Apelles, Lib.</hi> 31. <hi>Poſt tabulam latens vitia quae notarentur auſcultabat.</hi> He was at the back of the Frame which he ſet forth, and heard what Errors the Paſſengers noted in his Picture. So this Man's Ears were open, and his Eyes waking, groundleſs Repining never took him winking. Therefore to ſtraiten his Courſe againſt all Preſumption of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, he directed two Remonſtrances, the firſt to the Lord Marqueſs, <hi>September</hi> the 8th; the other to his Majeſty, <hi>October</hi> the 5th, 1622, which follow as he penn'd them.</p>

Although I do find by ſearch thoſe particular Charges of Chamber-Orders ſhew'd unto me by my moſt Noble Lord, the Lord Admiral, to be falſly laid, and wilfully miſtaken, as being either binding Decrees, or ſolemn Orders pronounced in open Court, and purſued only to Proceſſes of Execution by theſe private Directions. Yet do I find withal, that I have adviſedly, and with mature Deliberation, upon my entring into this Office, made many Diſpatches upon the Petitions of the Subjects, to mine own exceeding great Trouble, and to the Eaſe of their Purſes many thouſand Pounds in the Compaſs of this Year. For that Motion, which upon a Petition will coſt the Party nothing, if it be deny'd, nor above Five Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to the Secretaries (unleſs the Party play the Fool, and wilfully exceed that expected Fee) when it is granted, being put into the Mouth of a Lawyer, will coſt the Client, whether granted or deny'd, one Piece at the leaſt, and for the moſt part, Five, Ten or Twenty Pieces, as is notoriouſly known to all the World. Yet have I moſt willingly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all Orders upon Petitions, theſe Cautions following, which I received from Your Majeſty. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To order nothing in this kind, without Notice given to the adverſe Part, and Oath made thereof. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To reverſe, correct, or alter no one Syllable of any Decree or Order pronounced in Court, upon Counſel heard on both Sides. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To alter no Poſſeſſion, unleſs it be in purſuance to a former Decree, or Order pronunced in open Court; or to ſave (by a Sequeſtration to indifferent Hands) ſome <hi>Bona peritura,</hi> which commonly be a Tithe, or a Crop of Hay or Corn, which are ready to be carried away by force, by unreſponſal Men, and will not ſtay for a Decree in Court.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49492:55"/>be ſuſpected. The King ſtood to him, as he did always, and ſent him a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meſſage. It was his Conſcience he diſpenced in that Court, and he had his Approbation in all he had heard of. Truly, I believe his Majeſty's Love wrought that Ableneſs in him, to make him more than elſe he would have been. Neither did the Lord Marqueſs ſee any Reaſon, but to juſtifie his Integrity and Diligence, Yet before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term was ſpent, <hi>An.</hi> 1622, that great Lord dropt ſome Words, that he was not altogether pleas'd with the Lord Keeper's Obſervance, and look'd upon him with a ſtranger Countenance than before; ſo as from that time the Lord Keeper failed but with an half Wind in that mighty Lord's Favour; which he hid moſt prudently, and ſhew'd not the leaſt appearance that he was faln into that diſlike. As <hi>Macrobius</hi> commends <hi>Piſiſtratus, Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. whoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſecretly made Head againſt him. Yet <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> diſſembled ſtrangely that all was well between them, that the City of <hi>Athens</hi> might not practiſe upon their Enmity. So it was covered as artificially from Court and City, that theſe two Luminaries were near to Oppoſition. The firſt Man that was like to know it from the Lord Marqueſs, was the Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids;</hi> for about this time he ſtiles himſelf Confeſſor to his Lordſhip, in Mr. <hi>Prinn</hi>'s Publications. And within the compaſs of this Time, he ſays, he dreamt that the Lord Keeper was dead, that he went by, and ſaw his Grave a making. And how doth he expound this Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he ſaw in his Sleep, but that he was dead in my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Affections? Some are like to ask, what it was that did the ill Office to ſhake the Stedfaſtneſs of their Friendſhip? That will break out hereafter. But the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel began, that ſome Decrees had been made in Chancery, for whoſe better Speed, my Lord Marqueſs had undertaken. An Undertaker he was, without Confinement of Importunity, There was not a Cauſe of moment, but as ſoon as it came to Publication, one of the Parties brought Letters from this mighty Peer, and the Lord Keeper's Patron. For the Lord Marqueſs was of a kind Mature, in Courteſie more luxuriant, than was fit in his Place; not willing to deny a Suit, but prone to gratifie all Strangers, chiefly if any of his Kindred brought them in their Hand; and was far more apt to believe them that askt him a Favour, than thoſe that would perſwade him it was not to be granted. Theſe that haunted him without ſhame, to have their Suits recommended to great Officers, made him quickly weary of his faithful Miniſters, that could not juſtly ſatisfie him. I had mentioned none, but that I am beholding to the <hi>Cabal</hi> to fall upon one, the worſt of twenty, Sir <hi>John Michel, P.</hi> 84. of whoſe Unreaſonableneſs the Lord Keeper writes thus, <hi>God is my Wuneſs, I have never deny'd cither Juſtice or Favour (which was to be juſtified) to this man, or any other, that had the leaſt Relation to your good, and moſt Noble Mother. And I hope your Lordſhip is perſwaded thereof.</hi> Budaeus, <hi>P.</hi> 67. Upon the Pandects, writes offenſively upon the medling of ſuch Lady Advocates, <hi>Why may not Women be our Magiſtrates, and govern us, if they think to govern them, that are our Magiſtrates?</hi> But he complains with more Impatience againſt the Courtiers of <hi>Paris, P.</hi> 188. <hi>Quotuſquiſque eſt qui modo in aulâ interiore ſit alicujus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, qui non ſe dignum cenſeat, propter quem leges &amp; conſtitutiones, quamvis gravi ſanctione munitae, violari debeant?</hi> which makes the Place of a Judge a Burthen that cannot be ſupported. For as no Artiſt can make the Year run even by the Courſe of Sun and Moon, ſo no Juſtice can run even between the imperious Directions of a Favourite, and the Conſcience of a juſt Man. The Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs had uſed his Power to aſſiſt the Lord Keeper in his Lifting up; but good Turns are not to be counted a Servile Bond, to impoſe as much as ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded to be done, with a Blind-fold Readineſs: For no man in Earth is all in all a Servant, but to God. Gratitude may exact much, but Innocency is free from paying a Tribute. And 'tis pity they ſhould ever have the Ability to do Benefits, who over-lay their good Turns, and would not have thoſe, to whom they have been gracious, perſevere in Integrity. Yet many do ſo far value their own Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they think, for their good Works Sake, they have bought God's Part in us; which, if it be ſubſtracted, none are ſo ready to diſmount a Man, as they that did promote him.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49492:56"/>what I have heard the Counteſs Mother ſay upon it: That the Lord Keeper had great Cauſe ſometimes to recede from thoſe Courſes which her Son propounded; that ſhe never heard him different but that his Counſels were wiſe and well-grounded, ever tending to the Marqueſs's Honour, Safety and Proſperity; but that he ſtirr'd her Son to Offence with Reprehenſions that were too bold and vehement. I heed this the more, becauſe it was uſual with the Lord Keeper to be very angry with his beſt Friends, when they would not hearken to their own Good. Pardon him that Fault, and it will be hard to find another in him; as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> ſays of P. <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, for his Cholerick Moods, <hi>Hoc uno excepto vitio, non erat in illo quod quiſquam poſſit reprehendere.</hi> And if the Teſtimony of that Lady be true, (it is but one, and a moſt domeſtick Witneſs) I do not ſhuffle it over as if his Meanor to the Lord Marqueſs were not a little culpable. It was not enough to have Juſtice of his Side, without Diſcretion. Good Counſel is Friendly, but it muſt be mannerly. St. <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is enough to reprehend a few ſtout Words; but the Lord Keeper, for all the Frown of the Lord Marqueſs ſtaid upon him, carry'd as true a Heart toward him, and all his Allies, as exuberant in Gratitude, as ever liv'd in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrote to him, no not when he was quite forſaken; but he refreſh'd the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits he had receiv'd from him in his Memory. He never commanded him, but he obeyed in all, which was to be juſtified. No Danger impending over his Lordſhip, but he was ready to run an honeſt Hazard with him, even to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of his Life. In his Abſence, when a Friend is beſt tried, when his Lordſhip was in <hi>Spain,</hi> far from the King, and giving no little Diſtaſt there by his Bearing, then he ſmooth'd his Errors to his Majeſty, and kept him from Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, knowing that he had threatned to bring about his own Ruine. Yet in ſtrict Juſtice, a Founder loſeth his Right of Intereſt, that would deſtroy, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch his Foundation As Amber and Pearl are turned to mean Druggs and Duſt, when the Chymiſts hath drawn their Elixir out of them. At this ſtop I can reſolve one Queſtion, which many have ask'd me, whence the Occaſion ſprung, which transformed Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> from a Perſon ſo much obliged Eighteen Months before to the Lord Keeper, to the ſharpeſt Enemy. As ſoon as ever the Biſhop ſaw his Advancer was under the Anger of the Lord Marqueſs, he would never acknowledge him more, but ſhunn'd him, as the old Romans in their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition walk'd a loof from that Soil, which was blaſted with Thunder. It was an Opportunity ſnatch'd to pluck him back, that was got ſo far before him. Hold him down, that he might not riſe, and then he promiſed himſelf the beſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence in the Church; for he ſaw no other Rival. As <hi>Velleius</hi> ſays of <hi>Pompey,</hi> That he was very quiet, till he ſuſpected ſome Senator that thruſt up to be his Equal. <hi>Civis in tagá, niſi ubi 'vereretur ne quem haberet parem modeſtiſſimus.</hi> But, will a good Chriſtian ſay, did ſo much Hatred grow up from no other Seed?

For though he was a King of profound Art, yet he was not ſo fortunate in that Advice which he took, to ſend his dear Son the Prince with the Lord Marqueſs into <hi>Spain Feb.</hi> 17, 1022. So ſoon as thoſe Travellers had left the King with his little Court at <hi>New-Market,</hi> the King found himſelf at more Leiſure and Freedom, in the Abſence of the Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, to ſtudy the Calling of a Comfortable and Concordious Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Subject might reap Juſtice, and the Crown Honour.

The King prepared for the Conception of that Publick Meeting, that it might fall to its proper Work without Diverſions. He conceiv'd there was no Error more fatal to good Diſpatch, than that ſome Members took up the greateſt part of the Time, in ſpeaking to the Redreſs of petty Grievances, like Spaniels that rett after Larks and Sparrows in the Field, and paſs over the beſt Game. Therefore his Majeſty, to looſe no time, drew up a Proclamation with his own Pen, <hi>Feb.</hi> 20, to this end, that certain of the Lords of the Privy Council, ſhould have Power and ſpecial Commiſſion to receive the Complaints of all the good People of this Land, which ſhould be brought before them concerning any Exorbitances, Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, Oppreſſions, and Illegalities, and either by their own Authority, if it would reach to it, to ſee them corrected, or to give Orders to cut them off by the keeneſt Edge of the Laws. That Complainants ſhould be encouraged to preſent their Grievances, as well by the Invitement of the Proclamation, as by the Signification of the Judges to the Country and Grand Juries, in their reſpective Circuits. The Draught of this, the Features of his Majeſty's own Brain, came by Poſt to paſs the Great Seal. Yet for all that Haſt, the Lord Keeper took time to ſcan it, and ſent it back with Advice, that the Project would be ſweeter, if it were double refined; preſuming therefore, that his Majeſty would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſtop a little at the Bar of good Counſel, he wrote this enſuing Letter to the Court, <hi>Feb.</hi> 22.</p>

Fourthly, and Laſtly, The gaining of theſe Temporal Lords to ſide with the State, being formerly much wrought upon by the Factious, and Diſcontented. If Your Majeſty ſhall approve of theſe Reaſons,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49492:57"/>it is but to Command Your Secretary to interline theſe, or ſome of theſe Names in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which in all other reſpects is already wiſely and exceeding well penn'd, with two ſhort Clauſes only: Firſt, That theſe Lords ſhall attend very carefully and conſtantly in Term-time, when they are occaſion'd to be at <hi>London.</hi> Secondly, That they be inſtructed to receive all Complaints with much Civility and Encouragement, giving them full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Redreſs according to the merit of their Grievances: For nothing will ſooner break the Heart of a People, or make them loſe their Patience, than when hopes of Juſtice are fruſtrated, after the Royal Word is engaged. But if Your Majeſty in Your high Wiſdom will overpaſs theſe Particulars, which I have dutifully preſented, upon the return of the Proclamation as it is, it ſhall be ſealed, and divulged with all expedition.</p>

                  <p>But theſe Reaſons were not overpaſs'd: Both the Proclamation, and private Orders to the Lords Commiſſioners were reformed by the Contents of that weighty Letter; His Majeſty greatly inclining to the Lord-Keeper's Readineſs and eſpying Judgment in all Conſultations. For as <hi>Laertius</hi> in <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Life ſaid of a famous Muſician, <gap reason="foreign">

It will be to the Profit of the Reader, if I rub his memory with one Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Letter (for it is but one, though it come in twice,) which preſſeth the King to Sincerity and Reality; to fix his Word like the Center of Juſtice, that cannot be moved. <hi>Righteous Lips are the delight of Kings,</hi> Prov. 16.23. And a King of Righteous Lips is moſt delightful. Since the coercitive part of the Law doth not reach him, upon what Nail ſhall thoſe Millions that ſtand before his Throne hang their Hopes, if his Word do not bind him? A People that cannot give Faith to their Sovereign, will never pay him Love. It ſeems that the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Kings did profeſs to uſe Crookedneſs, and Windings of Diſſimulation in their Polity; therefore their Scepter was called <hi>Lituus,</hi> becauſe it bent in toward the upper end. <hi>But the Scepter of thy Kingdom</hi> (ſays <hi>David</hi> of GOD) <hi>is a right Scepter.</hi> A right one indeed: For Contracts and Promiſes bind God to Man, much more muſt they oblige the King to his People.

They that are too luxuriant in Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, are ſometimes barren in Judgment, as I will ſhew upon the Conjectures of this Name.

But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Multitude of Shifts begetting Multitudes of Laws, and Multitudes of Laws Difficulties of Interpretations, eſpecially where the Sword had engraven them in ſtrange Languages, as thoſe induced by the <hi>Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> into this Iſland, the State was enforced to deſign and ſelect ſome learned Men to prepare the Cauſes of the Client for the Sentence of the Judge, and <hi>the Sentence of the Judge</hi> for the Cauſes of the Client; who though never ſo Enobled by their Birth and Education, yet becauſe they ſucceeded in thoſe places of Servants, were alſo call'd <hi>Servientes, Sergeants,</hi> or <hi>Servants.</hi> Great Titles have grown up from ſmall Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, as <hi>Dux, Comes, Baro,</hi> and others, and ſo hath this, which is Enobled by the affix unto it, a <hi>Sergeant at Law.</hi>

In like manner your Name is a Name of Reverence, though you are ſtyled Servants: For you are the Principal of all that practiſe in the Courts of Law; Servants, that is, Officers preferr'd above all Ranks of Pleaders.

Digby,</hi> our King's Embaſſador Reſiant in the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> for a Match between our Prince, (who was by this time every where renown'd for the Diligence he ſhew'd to that brave Education which was given him) and the <hi>Infanta Maria,</hi> the much praiſed Daughter of his Maſter, the Mightieſt Chriſtian Potentate in <hi>Europe.</hi> Our King was paſſing well pleas'd, when his Servant <hi>Digby</hi> ſent him word of it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him to bring it to as much ripeneſs as he could. The Treatiſe went on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chearfully with the great Ones on both ſides, who were only, or chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it. But no People meddle more, or more impertinently, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of great things which are above them, than the paultrieſt of the Engliſh, I mean Shop-keepers, and Handycrafts-men. Theſe had ſome vain Fears which made them deaf to Reaſon, and ſwift to murmur. But the King was too wiſe to put his Honour, and his greateſt Actions under the Hazard of their Interpretation. That ſome of our Nobles ſided with the common Mans Opinion, it weighed as little. For they were ſuch as loved it like their Life to be commended by open Fame, and could not diſſemble, that their coldneſs to the Match was not without a Fever of Popularity. No diſcreet Perſon thought that the Succeſs would be the worſe, becauſe a few gay Coats forbid the Bands, with the Tryes and Dewces of Sedentary and Loitering Men. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays of Miſcellen Pulſes, ſowed together in <hi>Italy</hi> in his time, <hi>Nihil ocymo faecundius, quod maledictis &amp; probris ſerendum praecipiunt, ut laetius proveniat,</hi> Lib. 19. N.H. C. 7. The Husbandmen had a Superſtition to curſe it, or to give it all ill words, when it was ſown, and thought it would grow the better. With more Reaſon I may affirm it were Superſtition to imagine, that a good Deſign would the ſooner go back, becauſe it was raſhly malign'd by them that walk'd in <hi>Pauls,</hi> or throng'd together in the Markets. There was nothing like a halt in the Treaty of this Marriage between the two Kings, till the Prince Elector, our Kings Son-in-Law, made his Excurſion into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and left his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49492:59"/>own Country naked and undefenſible behind him, and loſt it. Though in fair dealing now the Nuptials ſhould have haſtned faſter to a Concluſion, than before, becauſe the young Parties were grown up to a mature Age for Marriage: Yet the Spaniard could be brought on to no diſpatch, but took reſpite of time about three Years, to reſolve how the Bridal-Joy ſhould be doubled with the Settlement of the <hi>Palſgrave</hi> in his own Principality. For till that was done, Peace between the two Kingdoms was but in a doubtful, and a catching Condition.</p>
                  <p n="126">126. The <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Court is ever ſlow; but, to make it worſe, it was ſuſpected, as I incline to think, uncharitably, that in this great Buſineſs it would not be ſure. It is incident when one State offends another, to impute the fault not to that one Errour, but to a general and National Vice. So the Spaniards were ſet out to the Prince in ſome buſie Pamphlets, and other Draughts put into his Hand, for ſuch as the Parthians are deſcrib'd in <hi>Juſtin.

But then upon the Bruit of the Prince's ſudden departure, ſo thinly Guarded for ſo long a Journey, even the Wiſeſt were troubled. The Courtiers, chiefly thoſe that wanted their Maſter, talk'd out their Diſcontents boldly. The Lords of the Counſel look'd dejectedly, that they were pretermitted in a Conſultation of ſo great Importance; but prayed heartily, That ſince his Majeſty was pleas'd to walk ſoftly that he might not be heard, his chance were not to tread away. Among them all, the Lord Keeper was the only Counſellor ſuſpected to be of the Plot. Yet he knew as little as the reſt; and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied their Lordſhips, that Ignorance was often a happy thing; as in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For if the Prince had gone out of the Kingdom privily with their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Knowledge and Counſel, and ſome miſfortune (which God avert) ſhould prevent his ſafe return, their Heads would be forfeited to Juſtice, and their Names expos'd to perpetual Infamy. Indeed this was but the ſecond time that King <hi>James</hi> had baulk'd his whoſe Counſel upon a like Occaſion: Not out of Confidence that he knew enough without them; but out of tenderneſs to their ſafety, that they might not undergo the Anger exacted upon ill Events, if God ſhould cauſe them. In the Year 1589. he cauſed ſome Ships to be Rigg'd, that the Admiral of <hi>Scotland</hi> might fetch Queen <hi>Ann</hi> out of <hi>Denmark:</hi> But when the Fleet was ready, he went Aboard himſelf, hoiſted Sails, and took his leave of no Man. For which ſudden Voyage, not imparted to the Lords that fate cloſe at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he gives this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to them in a Letter, (ſee it in worthy <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> pag. 377.) <hi>I took this Reſolution, none of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

That the King ſet this Wheel on Running to deſtroy <hi>Buckingham,</hi> for the hatred which he had long bore him, and would not think it ill to looſe his Son, ſo <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> might be loſt alſo, <hi>Pag.</hi> 149. <hi>O Horrid!</hi> But the beſt is the Foundation is Rotten: For <hi>Buckingham</hi> as all Men about the King would Teſtifie, was in as high Favour at that time, as any Subject was ever with his Sovereign. But when Sir <hi>A.</hi> to make out the Proof, he lays it upon Sir <hi>H.

Sir <hi>Harry</hi> was Unfortunate, but too honeſt a Man to ſow Diſcord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King, and his principal Peer and Attendant. Now mark upon what Bottom the Contriver of this Tale doth wind his Forgery. Sir <hi>W. Balfore,</hi> at the time of his Lieutenancy of the Tower, brought the Marqueſs at Midnight to Sir <hi>H.

Yelverton <hi>about ſuch a matter.</hi> For Learned <hi>Yelverton</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Priſoner to Valiant <hi>Balfore,</hi> Sir <hi>Allen Apſley</hi> was Lieutenant all the time of that worthy man's reſtraint. And Sir <hi>W. Balfore</hi> was not preferr'd to that Office of great Truſt, in more than four years after Sir <hi>Harry</hi> had obtain'd his Liberty; when Knaves will turn Fools, it is not amiſs to be merry with them. And I will fit Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> with a Jeſt out of <hi>Illuſtrius</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean, p.</hi> 23. <q>One <hi>Daphidas</hi> came to the <hi>Pythian</hi> Deity, to beſeech his Oracleſhip to tell him when he ſhould find a Gelding of his that was gone aſtray. <hi>You ſhall find him very ſhortly,</hi> ſays Apollo's <hi>Miniſter.</hi> I thank you for your good News, ſays <hi>Daphidas,</hi> but I have neither loſt a Horſe, nor have a Horſe to looſe.</q> So I turn Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> over to the Committee of Oracles and proceed. After the Princes Out Leap, the King lingred at <hi>New-market,</hi> till the time was nigh, that every day Tidings were expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of his ſafe Arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> that he might ſhew himſelf to the Lords at <hi>White-hall</hi> with better Confidence, which he did <hi>March</hi> 30. being the firſt day that the Lord Keeper ſpake with the King about his dear Sons Planetary Abſence. No ſooner had he made moſt humble ſign of his Majeſties Welcome by Kiſſing his Hand, but the King Laugh'd out this Queſtion to him; <q>Whether he thought this Knight-Errant Pilgrimage would be lucky to win the Spaniſh Lady, and to convey her ſhortly into <hi>England.</hi>

But if my Lord Marqueſs ſhould forget where he is, and not ſtoop to</hi> Olivares, <hi>or if</hi> Olivares, <hi>forgetting what Gueſt he hath Received with the Prince, bear himſelf haughtily, and like a</hi> Caſtilian <hi>Grandee to my Lord Marqueſs, the Provocation may be Dangerous to Croſs your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties good Intentions. And I pray God that either one or both of them do not run into that Errour.</hi> The King drew a Smile at the Anſwer, but bit his Lip at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage Diſcourſe, being Enlarg'd between them, the King perceiv'd that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor had other Fears, and that his Brain teemed with Jealouſies of very hard Encounters, which he knock'd upon ſoftly, that his Majeſty might diſcern them, and not ſeem to apprehend them. Only thus far the King proceeded, to ask him, <hi>If he had wrote to his Son and to the Lord Marqueſs clearly, and upon what Guard they ſhould ſtand.

But if the Health, Entertainment, and the principal buſineſs of His Highneſs, nay if any one of the Three ſhould miſcarry, You cannot in your Wiſdom and great Experience in this Court, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew, that the blame will be laid upon you. And therefore for Gods ſake prepare
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49492:60"/>your ſelf accordingly by Mature Deliberation to Encounter it. My Lord; for fear others will not, I will tell you the Truth. If I Offend you with my Truſty Care; I am ſure your good Nature will blow it over before we meet again. But in ſooth all the Court, and the Rabble of people lay this Voyage upon your Lordſhip. The King would ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as I hear, to take it to himſelf (and we have Advis'd him ſo to do by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) yet he ſticks at it, and many times caſts it upon you both. Thus Sir <hi>J. Epſley</hi> told me within this hour, whom I ſent to the Court of purpoſe to learn it. Nay Faces are more ſowred, and Rumors of Dangers more Encreaſed, becauſe you have defeated ſome great Lords, who expected to be imployed, for the Conduct of the Infant a hither. And though things ſpeed never ſo well, this Quarrel will remain. But I would that might prove the greateſt Danger. If Your Lordſhip will Command me what to do in Your Abſence, I hope you believe you have a faithful Servant, and wiſe enough to follow Directions. I will be as Vigilant in your Affairs, as my diſtance from the Court will give me Leave, Your Lady is well, but unapproachable and inviſible. Your little Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is very Pleaſant, and as it ſeems, bids us hope the beſt in her Infantile Preſage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. My Lady Your Mother is well, and chides me that I could not Divine, and Propheſie of your Journey. I will make bold to remember me to your Hoſt, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, the Earl of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> and his good Lady, my loving Country-woman. My Noble Lord, my Humble Suit unto you, and my beſt Advice is, that as all the Lords in <hi>England</hi> ſought your Lordſhip with all Obſervance in this Court, ſo you will ſeek and gain the great Lords of <hi>Spain,</hi> with as much Obſervance in the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> I ended His Highneſs Letter with a Text of Scripture, and I have another for your Lordſhip, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 24. ver. 48, 49. <hi>And I bowed my Head, and Worſhipped the Lord, and Bleſſed the Lord God of my Maſter <hi>Abraham,</hi> who hath led me in the Right-way to take my Maſters Brothers Daughter to his Son. And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my Maſter, tell me, that I may turn to the Right Hand, or to the Left.</hi> I Leave your Lordſhip in this Meditation, and in Gods Gracious Protection for ever.</p>

All things went well, and unanimouſly on the part of our Engliſh Counſellors in thoſe Foreign <hi>Juntoes,</hi> from hence, and ſo forth at leaſt to the beginning of <hi>May.</hi> Thus far 'twas eaſie to pleaſe them all. But there is one skill requir'd in a Calm at Sea, another in a Tempeſt: Though the Pilots good Will and Fidelity be conſtantly the ſame. Truſt to him for this, and he ſhall not fail. After he had parted from the King, ſo deeply Charm'd to beſtir his Wits in this Negotiation, he was as Active as one could be that had little to work upon. The Prince and his Paranymphus the Marqueſs had wrote ſome Letters upon the way, how far they had proceeded in their Journey. But the <hi>Buen</hi> Meſſage, that they were come to the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope</hi> in the City of <hi>Madrid,</hi> was not yet brought to the City of <hi>London;</hi> where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux at this time was very populous; their Errand being to hearken after News. And the particulars they long'd to hear of were theſe; <q>Whether His Highneſs were Arrived at the Court in <hi>Spain?</hi> When he would return again? (their Honeſt Affections ran too faſt to look for that ſo ſoon) Whether he were not Tamper'd withal to alter his Religion? And ſome were ſo reaſonable, and well pleas'd, (ſome were not) to ask, Whether he were Married, and would bring his Bride with him for hope of Future Iſſue?</q> As much Satisfaction was given to theſe Scruples from the Lord Marqueſs, by the Firſt Poſt that Arrived here, as could be expected in ſo ſhort a time, as he had ſpent abroad. Of which more in due time. But before his Lordſhip's came, the Lord Keeper wrote again, and again unto him to Aſſiſt the main buſineſs, and to pour in ſuch Counſels into his Lordſhip's Breaſt, as keeping cloſe unto them, he might promiſe himſelf more Grace with the King, and Commendation with the Subject. Philoſophers, who wrote the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of a Good life, agree, That unfeigned Love doth Juſtifie it ſelf in three Probations, or in either of them; when it is Faithful to a dead Friend, who ſhall never know it; or to a Friend undone in miſery, who cannot requite it, or to an Abſent Friend, who doth not perceive it.

His Majeſty lik'd it exceeding well; yet I have ſent it opened, that if your Lordſhip, and my Lord of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> who are upon the Place, ſhall not allow thereof, it may be ſuppreſſed. Truly the Reaſons are no Colours, but very real; that if new and tart Propoſitions, ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> occaſioned by the Poſſeſſion they have of his Highneſs's Perſon, ſhould protract this Marriage, the Prince is in great danger to ſuffer exceedingly in the Hearts and Affections of the People here at Home, and your Lordſhip ſure enough to ſhare in the Obloquies. Better Service I cannot do the Prince and your Lordſhip, than to thruſt on the Miniſters of the King of Spain, with the beſt Enforcements of my Judgment; who, if they dead this Buſineſs with a Calm, it is almoſt as bad as a croſs Gale. But, my Lord, I will not fail to continue as faithful to your Lordſhip, as to mine own Soul. Which to do at this time, is not thanks-worthy, his Majeſty being ſo conſtant, or rather ſo augmented in his Affections towards you, as all your Servants are extraordinarily comforted therewith, and the reſt ſtruck dumb, and ſilenced. But if any Storm (which God will keep off) had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, your Lordſhip ſhould have found a Difference between a Church-man and others, who hath nothing to regard in this World, but to ſerve God, and to be conſtant to his Friend; all the reſt being but Traſh to him, who can confine his utmoſt Deſires to a Book, and a little Chamber. But God Almighty never imparted unto you a greater Share of his Majeſty's Affections, that at this Time.</p>

That he ſhould have one of the chief Quarters of the King's Houſe for his Lodgings. One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Guard to attend him.

No marvel if ſuch a Gallant drew Affections to him at Home and Abroad, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which was a Court of Princes. But can that Nation paſs over ſuch a Triumph as this Entertainment, without Pumpian Words, and ruffling Grandiloquence? 'tis impoſſible. Therefore one <hi>Andres de Mendoza</hi> wrote a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all theſe Paſſages, which he dedicated to <hi>Don Juan de Caſtilià,</hi> wherein he pities us poor Engliſh, that we had ſeen nothing but Country Wakes, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-Plays, compared with theſe Rarities, which were the ſeven Wonders of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. And that King <hi>Philip</hi> did vouchſafe to make King <hi>James</hi> happy with his Alliance; as <hi>C. Caeſar</hi> honoured <hi>Amiclas</hi> the Water-man (called <hi>Pauper Amyclas, Lucan. Lib.</hi> 5.) to be waſted over into <hi>Italy</hi> in his Bark. Thus he went on with other flatuous Diſparagements. One Copy of this, and no more, came to the Leiger Embaſſador of the Catholick King, of which the Lord Keeper had the Uſe, and would never deliver it again; but wrote to my Lord Marqueſs, <hi>April</hi> 20th, to bid the Earl of <hi>Briſtow</hi> to take care, either to ſtifle it, if it were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd, or to cauſe it to be called in, if it were publiſhed.

The Accuſed were Innocent, and never gave ground to any pernicious Alteration; but themſelves, the Accuſers, have trodden down that Religion, of which, in their deep Hypocriſy, they would ſeem to be Champions. The Prince and <hi>Buckingham</hi> were ever Proteſtants; thoſe their Oppoſites, you know not what to term them, unleſs Deteſtants of the Romiſh Idolatry. As if all were well, ſo they be not Popified, though they have departed from the Church in which they were Baptized, and a Church, I will not ſay as ſound as it was in its Cradle in the Apoſtles Times; but as pure and Orthodox in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Government (as far as they were maintained to be of Divine Right and Conſtitution) as it was in its Childhood, in the time of their Diſciples, even that next ſucceeded them.

Here's a Knot of Catter-Pillars wrapt in a thin Cobweb, ſo eaſie it will be to ſweep them of. The accuſed Perſon was always free of Conference; Let any now living ſay that heard him often Diſcourſe of the adverſe Church, if he did not conſtantly open himſelf, not for a Gainſayer only, but for a Stiff Defier of their Corrupt Doctrines; (although he was ever pitiful for Relaxation of their Penalties) And would that Party cleave unto him for their greateſt Encourager? Encouragement was the leaſt their Head could give them: Beſide the Thing is a Chimaera. I never knew any Head of the Popiſh Faction in this Kingdom. Others, and Biſhops in Rank above him, have been traduced in that Name; but who durſt own that Office? eſpecially in the end of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign; when every year almoſt was begirt with a Parliament; and every Parliament procreated an inquiſitive Committee for Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

It could not, it did not, take a little in the higheſt Topicks to both.

And Judge the Biſhop by his own Words, in his Sermon Preach'd at the Funerals of that Good King, that his Majeſty charg'd his Son, though he Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Perſon of that Kings Siſter, never to Marry her Religion.

His Lordſhip gave the Lord-Keeper further Joy in the cloſe of his News, That the Diſpenſation from <hi>Rome</hi> was ſuddenly expected at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which would be the concluſion of the Buſineſs.

It is a Policy that grows to their State, as the Bark to the Tree, That they will ever dreſs their Counſels at a ſlow Fire: For they are always gaping after thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which Alterations may produce to their Advantage.

It may be ('tis ſo ſmall a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that I have not ſearched about it) that the Patent came with the Ships, that carried the Prince's Servants into <hi>Spain</hi> to attend his Highneſs, who went with the King's Order, and their own great Deſire, a moſt ſpecious Train of them, to viſit their dear Maſter, and to ſerve him in all Offices of his Family. Among theſe two were his Highneſs's Chaplains, who were ſent over to Officiate to him and his Court in the Worſhip of God. Theſe were Dr. <hi>Maw,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wrenn,</hi> both of prime Note for Learning and Diſcretion; very Learned to defend their own Religion; and very Diſcreet to give no wilful Offence to the oppoſite part in a Foreign Dominion. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> liked not their company; yet they took it not ſo ill, (for they could not but expect them) as that there was not one <hi>Romiſh Catholic</hi> declared for ſuch a one, among all his Highneſs's Attendants, <hi>Cabal, p.</hi> 15. <hi>Tully</hi> ſtates the Proverb in the Feminine Sex, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>ad Att.

Theſe were the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus of the Scene, that ſung in Tune with the chief Actor, and ſeconded his Part with their <hi>Symplaſma,</hi> (as it is called by ancient <hi>Muſicians</hi>) in their adherence to ſincere Religion: Yet ſome of theſe brought Inſtructions with them to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> from his ſecret Intelligencers, which not only diſturbed all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Treaties, but made the Prince return for <hi>England</hi> with the Willow Wreath: Becauſe the King, and they that were faithful to his meaning, knew not of it till <hi>July</hi> next after; let it ſquat till then, and it that order be ſtarted up. In this place it ſufficeth to glance at it, that the Duke was cunningly dealt with, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, by ſome whom he had leſt behind, to be as it were the Life-Guard of his Safety, who were to ſend him notice of common Talk, or ſecret Whiſpers that might concern him. Theſe perſwaded him to ſet the Match back by degrees, and in the end to overturn it. That this was the deſire of moſt Voices in <hi>England.</hi> And his Grace muſt look to ſtand by the love of the People, as well as of the King. Or if he could not prevail in that, let him be ſure to joyn the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with the Marriage in the Capitulations; or the Unſatisfaction, which all would take, that pitied the King's Daughter and her Children, would undo him.

Yet after they had given the Qu, now began the Duke to irritate the Spaniard, to ſhut out, or to ſlight the Earl of <hi>Briſtow</hi> in all Councels, to pour Vinegar into every Point of Debate; to fling away abruptly, and to threaten the Prince's Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe boiſtrous Moods were not the way to ſuccour the Prince's Cauſe: for Favour cannot be forc'd from great Spirits by offering Indignities. And the Temper of the Buſineſs in hand was utterly miſtaken. For they were not met at a Diet to make Articles of Peace and War; but to Woo a fair Lady, whoſe Conſent is to be ſought with no Language, but that which runs ſweet upon the Tongue.

                        <p>IT is my Fortune, and I thank God for it, to be ever rendring, and ever owing Thanks to your Grace. The Diſpenſation is come, and with it good Tidings, that your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage hitherto hath been ſo diſcreet, and the Event ſo fortunate, that our Maſter is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully pleas'd. But we were formerly never ſo deſirous to ſee that Box, that carries this Diſpenſation, than we are now to open it, and to know, by reading the ſame, what God hath ſent us. We all wonder at his Majeſties Reſervedneſs, for it came hither on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> laſt, this Day ſevennight But his Majeſty hath enjoyned Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert</hi> ſilence therein. And I believe, for my part at the leaſt, that Mr. Secretary hath perform'd his Commandment. We all think, and the Town ſpeak and talk of the worſt, and of very difficult Conditions. My dear Lord, You have ſo lock'd up all things in your own Breaſt, and ſealed up his Majesties, that now our very Conjectures (for more they were not) are altogether prevented. If things ſucceed well, this courſe is beſt; if otherwiſe, I conceive it very dangerous. But it were a great Folly to offer any Advice unto you, who only know what you tranſact in your own Cabinet. How then ſhall I fill up this Letter? To certifie this only, that all Diſcontents are well appeaſed, and will ſo remain without doubt, as long as Buſineſſes continue ſucceſsful. But if they ſhould decline, I am afraid the former Diſguſts of your appropriating this Service will ſoon be reſumed. And then how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it is to leave your Friends ignorant of your Affairs, and diſabled to ſerve you, I refer to your Graces Wiſdom and Conſideration. I do believe none of us all would keep your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel without a Charge to do ſo, (this keeping Counſel is a thing ſo out of faſhion) nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it, if it be otherwiſe required, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Lord Keeper in this Letter miſs'd the true Cauſe, why his Majeſty did not yet impart a ſight of the Diſpenſation to any of his Counſellors. The reaſon was, becauſe it came to him in a private Packet. And he expected it to be deliver'd to him, as it ought, by Publick Miniſters, the Ambaſſadors of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who kept it dormant about a Fortnight in their Hands, whether it proceeded from their Native <hi>Gravida,</hi> to retein that long in their Stomach, which needed no Concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or to liſten what the many-headed Multitude would ſay in <hi>London;</hi> or out of ſome other State-juggling. As I have laid forth in this, what was miſtaken by the L. Keeper, out of his own Memorials preſerv'd: So in another Line he hazarded his Love to be ill taken, repreſenting to the Duke the Truth, That the King did ſomewhat diſguſt his appropriating the whole Service to himſelf, that is, repulſing the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> or reſtreining him to ſilence, where their Counſels were held I know not, whether the Duke did ſo ſoon regret at this; for it is the firſt time; and 'tis well plaiſter'd over with mild Counſel. So Statuaries, ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi> do not only hew, and peck the Alabaſter upon which they work, but ſmooth it likewiſe, which is the neateſt part of their Cunning. By another Letter from the ſame Hand, dated near to the former, <hi>May</hi> 11. I perceive that the Duke, our Lord Admiral, demanded the Navy Royal to be made ready, and to be ſent to the Coaſt of <hi>Spain</hi> to conduct the Prince and his Followers Home. Which the King gave order to be done. But the Lord Keeper wrote to his Grace, if it were not with the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the main Matter not grown yet to any colour of ripeneſs: That the Charge would be very heavy to the <hi>Exchequer:</hi> Such a Fleet muſt be coſtly to be ſet forth, but far more coſtly to be kept long abroad. As for Coſt, it was the leaſt thing that was thought upon: It was no time for Frugality. The Stratagem was to have the Navy lie ready at Anchor, in ſome ſafe diſtance from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Havens; That if the Prince could recover no Satisfaction to reaſonable Demands from ſtiff <hi>Olivarez<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and other Grandees: Or if they perſiſted to burden the Match with inſupportable Conditions, his Highneſs after a ſhort Complement might take his leave, and have all things prepar'd at a Days warning, if the Wind ſerv'd, for his Reduction into <hi>England.</hi> With this Fleet ſome precious Ware, never ſeen, no nor heard of in <hi>Spain</hi> before, at leaſt among the Laicks, was tranſported thither; the Liturgy of our Church, tranſlated into the Spaniſh Tongue, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly printed, by the Procurement and Coſt of the Lord Keeper. The Tranſlator was <hi>John Taxeda,</hi> the Author of the Treatiſe call'd <hi>Hiſpanus Converſus,</hi> a good Scholar, once a Dominican, whom his Patron that ſet him on work ſecured to our Church with a Benefice, and good Prebend. He ſtudied this Tranſlation Day
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49492:65"/>and Night till it was ended. He that writes this was often at his Elbow to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him, when he put Queſtions how to proceed. But the Lord Keeper himſelf, with other Overſeers, that had perfectly learn'd the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Language, perus'd it faithfully, and, if there were not aptneſs in any phraſe, corrected it. With his Majeſties Privity, and great Approbation, two Copies of it were carried, Religious Tokens, the one to his Highneſs, the other to my Lord Duke, as the beſt and moſt undeniable Certificate that a particular Church can ſhew, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the right Profeſſion of their Faith from all Scandals, and to declare their Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all Chriſt's Ordinances ſquared, and practis'd by a publick Rule after the Beauty of Holineſs. A Book of Common-Prayer (which all call a Liturgie) is ſuitable to the Form of good Churches in all Ages; reduceth us to good Notions from wandring Extravagancies; preſerves Harmonious Conformity between all the Daughter-Churches, that are called from one Mother in one Realm, or State: It is our Witneſs to aſſoil us, when we are ſpitefully charg'd with Errours; ſo <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieras, Gerardus, Camero, Spanhemius, Amyraldus,</hi> and divers more the beſt of Modern Writers in defence of the Reformed way, draw their ſecond Rank of Arguments, next to the Sacred Scriptures, out of their Liturgies to juſtifie their Tenents. Finally, with this Office of Divine Worſhip, he that celebrates Gods Service, is ready at all times to offer up to God the Sacrifice of Prayer, when ſome perhaps at ſome times are affected with Languor of Health, and then not ſo ſit to ſpeak ſuddenly to God in the behalf of the People; and when the moſt have Infirmity of Judgment, and are unſit at all times. Beſhrew the Tettar of Pride that runs over many Wits, and makes them care for nothing that's made ready to their Hand; and puts them in love with nothing but their own Conceptions. What have we loſt? Nay, What hath God loſt in the Honour due unto him? How is his Truth? How is his Name? How is his Glory diſ-reverenced over all this Land, ſince our Liturgie hath been Mortgag'd to the Directory?</p>
                  <p n="139">139. It would be remembred, that this comes in upon the mention of the Fleet, call'd for and haſtned to weigh Anchor at <hi>Chattam,</hi> and to ride near to St. <hi>Anderos,</hi> to bring the Prince for <hi>England,</hi> if there were a rupture in the Treaty. But if they ſhould ſuddenly ſtrike Hands, and make a Bargain, my Lord Duke had his Thoughts upon a Queſtion, which if it ſhould be ask'd, he would not be ſurpriz'd as if he were ignorant what to anſwer, that is, <hi>What Dowry ſhould be granted to the Princely Bride?</hi> Therefore he conſulted the Lord Keeper, and required Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be brought by a Courier, that muſt not ſpare Horſe-Fleſh; who was hied away as faſt as he could be with this Anſwer.</p>

                  <p>Theſe are the Negotiations which the Lord Keeper for his Share, at this Seaſon, brooded under the Wings of Fidelity and Prudence.

                  <p n="140">140. It is enough declared how the great Matters about the Match went here. The Diſpenſation of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the XV. turn'd them round in <hi>Spain,</hi> till they were giddy with the Motion. It was expected it ſhould come in the common Church Style, an abſolute and Canonical Diſpenſation, and no more; only for her Sake that was in Submiſſion to his Laws: But it was Compounded with ſo many Reſervations, and ill-viſag'd Proviſoes, that it ſwell'd like a Tympany. The Pope knew with home he had to deal: For there are none in the Earth more Superſtitious to do him Honour then the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his People. That King would make the Pope too big for a Prieſt, that the Pope might make him too great for a King. Nor is there any other intent, to make that Patriarch of the Weſt the ſole capacious Fountain, from which all Pipes of Grace and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence Eccleſiaſtical ſhould be fill'd, and run abroad, but principally to Water his own Garden. What between the Nuncio Reſiant at <hi>Madrid,</hi> who was Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſtop all Proceedings, till ſafety were granted; nay, and put in Execution, both for Engliſh and Iriſh Catholicks as much as they ask'd: What with the Charge given to the Inquiſitor General, to uſe all poſſible diligence to draw the Prince to his Holineſs's Obedience; What with <hi>Olivarez</hi>'s frowardneſs, of whom the Duke could not obtain to put a Poſtſcript in his Letter to the Pope, that to add theſe new and un-reliſh'd Conditions, with which the Diſpenſation was Clogg'd, would be interpreted the worſt of Unkindneſs; what with all theſe together, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might ſay, <hi>Fat Bulls of</hi> Baſan <hi>have compaſſed me in on every ſide.</hi> A little Honey, (God wot, a little) was allowed to to the Lip of the Cup, if he would Taſte of that Potion; that was, that from thenceforth his Highneſs might have acceſs to his Dearly Affected Miſtreſs; not as formerly, a bare Viſitant, but now as a Lover; ſo ſome of their chief States were in preſence to hear all their Conference, a Rule which they ſay is never Infring'd in the grave way of the Caſtilian Wooing. The old Man <hi>Gregory</hi> the XV. gave light himſelf to his Friends and Servants in <hi>Spain,</hi> what they ſhould do by the Flame of his own Zeal. For he ſent a Letter to the Prince, Signed with the Signet-Ring of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to exhort his Highneſs with many words, to reduce himſelf, and the Kingdoms of which he was the Heir, to the Subjection of the Roman See. Hereupon, ſome of our Hot-Heads in <hi>England</hi> made it a Quarrel and a Calumny, that the Prince ſent an Anſwer of Civility to the Popes Epiſtle. Civility, though it is a thing unknown among the Plebeians and Clowns, is a Virtue among Gentlemen; And will they make a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue Criminal? But where lies the Offence? Perhaps that his Highneſs ſhewed no diſreliſh in his Anſwer to the PopesMotion; Neither did he ſhew Encouragement, ſo far the Terms are even. Fair Language in that Caſe would coſt the Prince nothing, it would ſave him much: For the more Hurt the Pope could do, the leſs he was to be diſpleas'd with Provocation. To go further, He that will Cenſure an Action, muſt not Judge upon it Naked, but with all its Copartments. Many Things that were well done, if you will peel away the Bark of their Circumſtances, will ſeem Reproachfull. The Behaviours of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 20.26. in the

But the ſtrongeſt hold, which his Highneſs's Juſtification will maintain for ever againſt all Aſſaults, is, That the whole Contents of his Letter were unblameable, and yet very unpleaſing to the High Prieſt, to whom he wrote. Take the expreſs Words, and only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted. <q>The Exploits of my Noble Predeceſſors have not been more, than the Care which I have, that the Peace of the Church might be bounded in true Concord, and as the Glory of God requires our Endeavours to unite it I do not Eſteem it greater Honour to be Deſcended from ſuch Princes, than to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in true Zeal of Piety. In which it aſſures me much, to have known the Mind and Will of our thrice Honour'd Lord and Father, to give concurrence to ſo laudable a Deſign. For it doth not grieve him a little to ſee that great evil grows from Diviſion of Chriſtian Princes; whoſe peaceable Settlement, if this Marriage between the Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> and my ſelf may procure, I ſhall the rather conclude my Happineſs therein: For, as I have been far from encouraging Novelties, or to be a Partiſan in any Factions againſt the Catholick Religion, ſo ſhall I ſeek occaſion to take away Suſpicions, that I deſire but one Religian, and one Faith, ſeeing we all believe in one Jeſus Chriſt; having reſolved in my ſelf to ſpare nothing that I have in the World, my Eſtate and Life, for a thing ſo pleaſing unto God, whom I implore to give your Holineſs Health and Happineſs.</q> A Synod, or an Aſſembly of Divines, <hi>Togati vel Palliati,</hi> could not have handled the Pope with greater Wit and Dexterity. Who is pincht to the quick in the Letter, and yet could not juſtly complain of Uncivility, or Exaſperation. The Prince promiſeth to follow the Footſteps of his Father; as <hi>Spartianus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Geta,</hi> Son to Emperor <hi>Severus, Paternarum ſententiarum memor,</hi> he could not dreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf better than by his Fathers Glaſs. And how doth he promiſe to follow him in that which he had begun? To accord the Variances of all Chriſtian Churches, that their Peace might be bounded in true Concord: Which is as much as to bring the Pope to be Sub-Canonical; to Conform him to the Decrees of a free Council, called by Chriſtian Monarchs.

From hence the Embraces of Truth may ſee, how ſtaringly falſe, and daringly impudent that Report is, That the Prince had not come out of <hi>Spain,</hi> but that he leſt his Faith, as well as his Proxy behind him; and got thence with the very ſame Trick that Sir <hi>Francis Mitchel</hi> ſaid he got out of the Inquiſition at <hi>Rome;</hi> which is a <hi>Welde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> p. 162. a familiar Trope in the Rhetorick of the blatant Beaſt.</p>

Theſe were the main Sticklers to do a real miſchief, only to ſatisfie a Fantaſtical Jealouſie. The Tears of their Lamentation dropt upon the Popes tender heart, ſo that, to comply with them, many a bitter Kernel was in the Core of the diſpenſation. And I have Reaſon to ſuſpect they were ſome Grains the worſe, that the French, employ'd at <hi>Rome</hi> at that time, did the worſt Offices they could, as the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> our Kings Embaſſador in <hi>France</hi> wrote hither, <hi>Cabal. pag.</hi> 301. <q>Thoſe of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Councel at <hi>Rome</hi> will uſe all the means they can to the Pope (in whom they pretend to have very particular Intereſt) not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt, but to break Your Majeſties Alliance with <hi>Spain.</hi>

Therefore they come to thoſe, who were our Princes employ'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, to require of them to give their beſt help to rowl away this Stone, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49492:67"/>was the main Obſtruction. On our Part therefore we ask'd two Queſtions; Firſt, Whether King <hi>Philip</hi> could take ſuch an Oath for another King? Guardians may take Oaths in the behalf of Minors, whom they Govern'd; for it was in their Power, and it lay upon their Charge, to perform that which they ſwore for Minors, till they came to Age. We had heard of ſome, who were wont in ſome places, that procured the Cauſes of their Clients in Civil Courts, to take an Oath in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimam Domini ſui, vel in Animam conſtituentis;</hi> but ſuch as Weighed Religion more by Conſcience, then by Cuſtom, deteſted it. <hi>For who can Swear before God to oblige the Soul of another? Since an Oath muſt be taken in Judgment, as well as in Truth;</hi> Jerem. 4.2. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were be-gruntled with theſe Scruples. And their Recourſe was to a Convention of their ſoundeſt Divines, to deliver their ſentence upon it; who walk'd as ſlowly and gingerly, as if they had been foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. They toſs'd over Books; they ſearch into the <hi>Code,</hi> the <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts;</hi> Read tedious Lectures, and caſt up a Trench of a hundred Scruples to Beſiege this little Queſtion. The Prince, whoſe Humanity and Wiſely-Govern'd Temper was admir'd of all, took the waſt of time, that theſe Divines made, in great Offence. Now was the firſt time that he ſpake that unkind Word to <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares, That he was Wrong'd, and wiſh'd himſelf in his own Court again. Olivares</hi> Chaſed as faſt; that their Fatherhoods, with their Mountains of Learning, ſate ſo long to bring forth a Mouſe, and blamed himſelf (as it was reported in our Parl. <hi>Anno</hi> 1624.) <hi>That the Devil put it into his mind to call that Aſſembly.</hi> For all this the Divines would be known in their Place, and would not break up their meeting, till they had Reſolv'd after twenty days, what they determined to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the firſt hour, <hi>That King</hi> Philip <hi>might take the Oath;</hi> wherein yet we gained thus much on our part, that a Point, which was Reſolved by the Pope and his Conclave, ſubſcribed by them all, Committed to the Nuncio to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with St. <hi>Peters</hi> Authority; might be diſputed twenty days by a Chapter of private Divines. Let them ſit twenty days more to ſatisfie us, whether it were good Theology, or good manners, to ſerve him ſo, whoſe deciſions, they ſay, are inerrable. When the Grave Doctors of <hi>Salamanca</hi> had acquitted themſelves ſo learnedly, his Highneſs's Miniſters moved another Queſtion, Whether King <hi>Philip</hi> would take the Oath as Procurator for our King, who nor requir'd it, nor was privy to any thing that was ſtuff'd into the Procuration. To which a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Anſwer was given, and no bad one; it could not be Reſolved, before the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Counſel ſaw, how far our Prince and his Counſel would yield in points of Religion. And how can we tell you that, ſaid they of our part, before you bring forth the whole Plump of your Articles? No Fence could thruſt by this Queſtion, but that it would ſtick faſt in the Cauſe. So we gained again, that King <hi>Philip</hi> was reſtreined from making Faith for King <hi>James.</hi> And although the Froathy Formality of promulging the Diſpenſation was kept back, yet the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles came into Play, that the Commiſſioners on both ſides might fall to a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

Yet <hi>David,</hi> ſo near the Crown, call'd himſelf a dead Dog, or a Flea in reſpect of <hi>Saul.</hi> Nor is it omitted that he was ſometime cover'd when the Prince was bare, ſometime ſitting when the Prince ſtood, capering a loſt in ſudden Fits, and Chirping the Ends of Sonnets; which was not Unmannerlineſs, he was better bred; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs, which will creep upon him, who was too much dandled upon the Lap of Fortune. Or as <hi>Budaeus</hi> better Expreſſeth it <hi>Sap.

For the French Mode is bold, Light and Airy. That which we call rudeneſs, with them is freedom, good Metal, brave aſſurance. And that which we, and the Caſtilians call Gravity or Modeſty, with them is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sneaking, want of Spirit, Sheepiſhneſs. But between frets of Spight, and Fits of Levity, the Duke put the Treaty ſo far out of Tune, that the Lovers were diſappointed of their expected Epithalamium. So that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made it one of their Refranes or Proverbs: If the Prince had come alone (without the Duke) he had never return'd alone (without the brave <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Virgin) they might ſay ſo freely; for I heard himſelf ſay no leſs in the Banqueting Houſe at a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Lords and Commons <hi>anno</hi> 1624. When he endear'd himſelf to the Hearers, <q>That the Stout and Reſolute way wherein he went had overturn'd the Marriage, and did Arrogate the Thanks of all things to himſelf, that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and popular:</q> So be it; yet that which Canoniz'd him with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then, was afterward made an Evidence againſt him, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 227. To lay a Dram of Excuſe againſt a Pound of Error, this is to be Alledged, that <hi>Olivares</hi> and Count <hi>Montes-claros</hi> were ill Advis'd to ſpurn a young Lion, as if he had been a Puppy-Whelp. For as ſoon as they ſaw the Duke ſoare ſo high in his Opinions, and when <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſpake to mitigate him, diſaccount of him contemptibly, as if he had nothing to do, this Brace of Grandees call'd it in Queſtion, what Creature could have more Power in that Action, then an Embaſſador, that laid the firſt Stone of it, that had ample Letters of Credence under the King's Broad-Seal, with the Confirmation of the Privy-Council of <hi>England,</hi> which was more then my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> brought with him. The Headſhip of the Treaty was in the Prince, and they bended to it, Extolling his Wiſdom as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> doth <hi>Gordianus</hi> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Moribus it a moderatus, ut nihil poſſis dicere quod nimiè fecit.</hi> The next place they deemed to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> upon the Reaſon premiſed, though he declin'd it. And ſhould <hi>Buckingham</hi> be degraded to be the third in Place, who held the Higheſt Place in Honour, and the Supremacy both in the King's, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Favour: <hi>Auſonius in Paneg. ad Gratian.</hi> tells a Story, That <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great Reading thoſe Verſes in <hi>Homer,</hi> that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> was Nam'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers to Fight the Duel with <hi>Hector</hi> after <hi>Aiax</hi> and <hi>Diomedes,</hi> clapt out

So he did allay all other Heats, which the Duke's Paſſion raiſed againſt him, if his Letter to the Lord Keeper be of Canonical Faith, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 21. knowing how undecent and ſcandalous a thing it is, for the Miniſters of Princes to run different ways in a ſtrange Court. But the Envy of all Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages was caſt upon his Lordſhip by that mighty Adverſary, and by a greater than he. That he was wholly Spaniolized, which could not be, unleſs he were a Penſioner to that State. That he ſided with <hi>Olivarez</hi> in all Conſults. That he profeſſed a Neutrality, and more, in all Propoſitions for the Advancement of the Popiſh Religion. That he never Pleaded for the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> but only pitied it with the Spaniſh Shrug. That he did not ſo timely unmask the Spaniſh Councils to the Kings Advantage, as he might, and ought to have done. That he entangled the Prince in Delays, to keep him from returning Home. For theſe, and other the like, which will follow in the great Report made in the next Parliament, a Noiſe was made, that his Lordſhip ſhould be offered up to Juſtice, as a publick Sacrifice. But they that conteſt for his Innocency, obſerve, that he was let looſe to depart in Quiet, when he ſhould have been brought to the Horns of the Altar. And when the Bill drawn up againſt him, was put into Sir <hi>Robert Philip</hi>'s Hand, an active, and a gracious Member of the Houſe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it to his Ruine, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> writes to the Duke, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 265. <hi>If</hi> Briſtol <hi>frame a probable ſatisfactory Anſwer to any Charge, will it not rather ſerve to declare his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, than to prepare his Condemnation?

Porter,</hi> carried him forth in all haſt to make up the Match; but there were others, who deſired his Grace to gratifie them with Concealment for their Good-will, that ſent Inſtructions into <hi>Spain,</hi> to adjure him to do his utmoſt to prevent the Eſpouſals. Their Reaſons were the two principal Places of Divine and Humane Wiſdom, God's Glory, and his own Safety. For God's Sake, to keep our Orthodox Religion from the Admixture of that Superſtition, which threatned againſt the Soundneſs of it. And no Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſo good to eat out the Corruption of Romiſh Rottenneſs creeping on, as to give the Spaniard the Dodg, and to leave the Daughter of <hi>Spain</hi> behind. To his own Safety this Counſel was contributed. Theſe, who made it their Study, and were appointed to it, to maintain the Grandeur of his Lordſhip, met frequently at <hi>Wallingford-houſe,</hi> to promote the Work. Who had obſerved, that ſome Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were gotten into the King's Mind, and they knew by whom, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was reſolved to be a Lover of Parliaments, that he would cloſe very graciouſly with the next that was called; nor was there Likelihood that any private Man's Incolumity, though it were his Grace himſelf, ſhould cauſe an unkind Breach between him and his People. Therefore the Cabinet-men at <hi>Wallingford-Houſe,</hi> ſet upon it to conſider, what Exploit this Lord ſhould commence, to be the Darling of the Commons, and as it were to re-publicate his Lordſhip, and to be precious to thoſe, who had the Vogue to be the chief Lovers of their Country. Between the Flint and the Steel, this Spark was ſtruck out; that all other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts would be in vain, unleſs the Treaty for the great Marriage were quaſht, and that the Breach of it ſhould fall notoriouſly upon the Lord <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Induſtry. For it was not to the Taſt of the Engliſh (if you will number them, and not weigh them) fearing ſome Incommodation to the Proteſtant Religion Theſe <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabs,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.3. the Subtle Friends of beauteous <hi>Abſalom,</hi> drew the Duke out of the King's High-way into the By-path of Popularity. The Spaniards alſo ſtir'd up his Fire to ſtruggle and appear againſt them—For as the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> writes, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 20. He was very little beholding to them for their good Opinion. Withal, he was ſo head-ſtrong, that all the Miniſters of our King, that were joyned with him, could not hold him in. He had too much Superiority, to think them his Fellow Servants, that were ſo indeed. And having nothing in his Taſt but the Pickle of thoſe new Counſels, which his Governing Friends in <hi>England</hi> inſus'd into him, he pluckt down in a few Weeks, which the other Part had been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in eight Years. <hi>Centum doctúm hominum concilia ſola devincit Dea Fortuna, Plaut. Pſeud. Act.</hi> 2. This unfortunate Accident did both contravene, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match the Counſels of a hundred wiſe Men. A fatal thing it hath been always to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49492:71"/>Monarchs, to be moſt deceived, where they have truſted moſt. Nay, If they had all the Eyes of <hi>Argos,</hi> their chiefeſt Confidents are able to abuſe them on the blind Side. Therefore the Obſervator is moſt injurious, that puts a low Eſteem upon King <hi>James</hi>'s Wiſdom. <hi>P.</hi> 14. That he was over-witted, and made uſe of to other Mens ends, by almoſt all that undertook him. So he may put the Fool upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was couſen'd in <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> whom he made Ruler over all the Charge of the Houſe of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.28. A <hi>Solomon</hi> may be miſtaken in a <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and like his ſeeming Faithfulneſs and Sufficiency to the Undoing of his Poſterity. Little did the old King expect, that the Man of his Right-hand, whom he had made ſo ſtrong for his own Service upon all Occaſions, would forget the Truſt of his Gracious Maſter, and liſten to the Voice of Hirelings. Which of the Members of my Partition will make the Duke excuſable in point of Honour and Conſcience? Did he do it for the beſt to the King? Did he think the Spaniſh Alliance would be fruitful in nothing but Miſeries, and that it would be a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Office to lurch the King in his Expectation of it? Evil befall ſuch double Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Perhaps it may be ſhifted off with the Name of a good Intent, when it tampers with a Branch, or Circumſtance of an Injoyment; but when it raiſeth up the very Body of Inſtructions, 'tis no more competent with Obedience, than Light with Darkneſs. The Heathen would not brook it, that had a grain of Philoſophy in their Diſpoſition, that a Miniſter ſhould alter the Mandates of his Superior, upon Suppoſes to the better: <hi>Ne benè conſulta, Religione mandati ſoluta, corrumperentur, Gell. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13. They thought that thoſe Services, which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Religion of Obedience, let their Aim be never ſo honeſt, would prove improſperous. Or did this great Lord do it for the beſt to himſelf? I believe it. If the Hope of the Match died away, he lookt to get the Love of the moſt in <hi>England;</hi> but if it were made up, he lookt for many Enemies, for he had loſt the Love of the beſt in <hi>Spain.</hi> Sir <hi>Wal. Aſton</hi> foreſaw wiſely, that there was no fear, but that the Princely Lovers might joyn Hands in Sacred Wedlock, if that Fear of the Duke could be removed. So he writes, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 32. <hi>Would your Grace would commit it to my Charge, to inform the Infanta what you have merited, and to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date all other Miſtakes here concerning that Proceeding. If your Grace would reconcile your Heart, I would not doubt, but, with the Concluſion of the Match, to compoſe all things to your good Satisfaction, and to bring them to a true Underſtanding of you, and of their Obligation unto you.</hi> But his Lordſhip knew what he had deſerved, and that it was not poſſible to look for good Quarter from them: So he cut off the Thread of the Match with theſe Sciſſors. The Love of the Engliſh muſt not be loſt; the Love of the Spaniard could not be gain'd. But it was paſſing ill done of him to deal ſo with his dear Maſter, to whom he owed more than ever he could pay; for whom he ſhould not have been nice to hazard his Preſervation. He knew the bottom of the King's Boſom, that his Majeſty accounted this great Alliance to be the Pillar of his preſent Honour, and the Hope of his future Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity: That all his Counſels with foreign States turned upon that Hinge: That he looked for golden Days with it, which would fill our People with rich Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, and ſpread Peace over all the Borders of <hi>Europe.</hi> He knew his Lord the King deſired to live but to ſee it finiſhed, and car'd not to live after he ſaw it vaniſhed. <hi>Crediderim tunc ipſam fidem humanam negotia ſpeculantem, maeſtum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum geſſiſſe,</hi> Valer. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. Let the Duke have his deſerved Praiſes in other things great and many; but let Fidelity, Loyalty and Thankfulneſs hide their Face, and not look upon this Action. Let his Friends that did drive him to it, and wrought upon his flexible Diſpoſition, bear much of the Obloquy. For it is not <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>Politici,</hi> that carried the Duke athwart with their excentrick Motion, were very impatient to be diſcovered. They thought they had beat their Plot upon a quilted Anvil, and that their Hammer could not be heard. But time is a Blab, which will tell all Secrets, and ſpared not this. The Lord Keeper was much maligned, as the Author of the Detection: Yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved not the Glory, for it was the King himſelf by this Occaſion. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of the Catholick King, preſſed that the Articles, aſſented to by the Prince, and thoſe about him, ſhould be ratified. And Preparation was made to give them Satisfaction. So the Lord Keeper aſſures the Duke, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 78. <hi>The King is reſolved to take certain Oaths you have ſent hither, and I pray God afterwards no further Difficulty be objected.</hi> Theſe Oaths being brought to diſcuſſion at the Council-Table,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49492:71"/>there were among the Lords, that ſuppreſt their Conſent, till better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge did warrant them, and ſome Aſpect of Neceſſity did make them reſolute to Agreement. While theſe few of the Lords were ſuſpenſive in their Judgment, it was brought to the King, that ſome, profeſt Servants and Creatures of the Duke's, cavilled at certain Articles in the matter of the Oath, and were very buſie to puzzle thoſe, who had not yet compleatly deliberated upon them. The King laid this to other things he had heard (and he was able to put much together in a Glance of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) and called one of them, that was employed in this unacceptable Office, to a private Conference, whom his Majeſty handled with ſuch ſearching Queſtions, conjured with ſuch Wiſdom, wound into him with that Sweetneſs, that he fetcht out the Myſtery; yet giving him his Royal Word to conceal his Perſon. <hi>Sic ſuo indicio periit ſorex.</hi> So the Rat was catcht by his own Squeaking. This his Majeſty imparted to the Lord Keeper and Marquiſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſcomforted upon it; for here was a Danger found out, but not a Remedy. Yet he went on (chearfully to all ſeeming) to that which was come to a ripe Head, and gave Command to the Lord Keeper to prepare all things for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Confirmation of the Covenants, that were brought from <hi>Spain.</hi> He went went about it, and had about him thoſe three Qualities which run together in St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Not ſlothful in Buſineſs, fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord:</hi> That is, Diligence, Courage, Conſcience. Zealots, who are favourable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they think they have among them the Monopoly of Conſcience, had been able to diſcourage another, who in common Diſcourſe, laid no leſs Crime than Atheiſm, no Religion upon him that ſhould give Furtherance to a Popiſh Marriage; much more, if for Reaſons of State-Compliance, he ſhould refreſh the Party adherent to <hi>Rome</hi> with any Mercy or Favour. But this man regarded not Rumors before Reaſon; God had given him a Spirit above Fear, which, he would often ſay, had the greateſt Influence in the Corruption of two brave things, Juſtice, and good Counſel.

The Precedent for this Work, he conceived would be to turn over the Paper Stories of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, when the firſt and ſecond Dukes of <hi>Anjou</hi> were propounded for Husbands to that glorious Lady, of whom the latter came ſo near to ſpeed, that wiſe <hi>Burleigh,</hi> with others that had gray Hairs, and grave Heads, drew up a Book for the Conſummation of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Lay that Treaty with the French Monſieur, and this of <hi>Spain</hi> together, and there needs no ſtriving to bring them to great Reſemblance in the Compariſon. There was as much Diſparity in Religion between the one Pair, as the other. The Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> came as unexpectedly to the Queen at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> as the Prince came unlooked for to <hi>Madrid.</hi> The Duke brought but two or three in Train, <hi>Camb. Eliz.

Eight years paſt, and nothing paſt beſide, for both the Lovers were non-ſuited in the end. The Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou</hi> courted the Queen, when her People regretted, that he beſieged the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>Rochel</hi> at the ſame time, <hi>Gladio ejus eorum cruore intincto, qui eandem quam Angli profitentur Religionem, Camb.

And the People are like themſelves in all Ages, who commonly ſuſpect ſome Evil from their Governours, when they will be wiſer than they: So that it is very rare to look to the Publick, as it ought, and to be in Poſſeſſion of moſt Hearts; but as <hi>Tul.

Which preſently is to be Tried, For the Articles gain-ſaid by a great Out-cry came to the Touch-Stone, <hi>July</hi> 20. being <hi>Sunday,</hi> and were preſented before to His Majeſty to Swear unto, and to the Lords of the Council to ſubſcribe their Approbation; which were of two ſorts. Some belong'd to the Infanta, and her Train of Houſhold, and no further: Some belong'd to all the Engliſh, that had taken the Mark of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their Hand. Of the former, three, and no more, did ſeem to be Litigious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Princeſſa</hi> and her Servants ſhould enjoy the Uſe of their own Religion, without Trouble or Moleſtation, and a Chappel to be built, adjoyning to her Court, for the more full and decent Exerciſe of it; which held little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, for the provident Councel of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> made no ſcruple to conſent to the like in expreſs Words. <hi>Dux, &amp; ſui, modo non ſint Nativi Angliae Subjecti, ſuam li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beri Religionem exerceant in conſtituto aliquo loco in ſuis aedibus, ſine impedimento;</hi> ſo the Foundation was laid of the Chappel, adjoyning to St. <hi>James</hi>'s place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Princeſſa</hi> ſhould be truſted with the Education of the Children lawfully begotten between them, till they came to Ten Years of Age. A ſtring that grated harſhly; yet heard by Wiſe-men with more Laughter, then Fear. For Childhood is not apt to take any perilous impreſſion in intellectual Points; and they would be often with the Father, and thoſe about him, and unlearn corrupt Principles. Chiefly it was foreſeen, that it was a Gratification, that would die out of it ſelf, and expire in proceſs of ſo long a time. And in all Councils much muſt be aſcrib'd to the Foreſight of Prudence; as <hi>Nepos</hi> ſays in the Life of <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Facile intelligi poteſt prudentiam eſſe quandam Divinationom.</hi> Prudence ſees ſo far before it, that it comes not ſhort of a kind of Divination.

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Clergy waiting upon the <hi>Princeſſa</hi> ſhould be ſubject to no Laws, or Statutes of <hi>England</hi> already made, or that ſhould be made hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Methinks no Honeſt man, that lives in Humane Society, ſhould ask ſuch an Immunity, though it were poſſible to be Granted. Yet their Clerks do not ask it, but Arrogate it.

That is, they do well to conform to the Eſtabliſh'd Laws of any Nation, where they live, for the maintenance of Peace, and uſual Commerce: But if it ſeems better to them to avoid thoſe Laws, and not obſerve them, they cannot be puniſh'd by, no nor cited to the Courts of Secular Magiſtrates.

IF I ſhall touch upon any Service, which I may ſeem to have performed towards Your Higneſs, I humbly beſeech your Highneſs to conceive, I do it not to pick Thanks, and much leſs to put any acknowledgment upon your Highneſs; but only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my ſelf of that part of Duty, which all the World knoweth I do, above all Men in the World, owe unto your Highneſs. Before I did imagine, that his Majeſty would take any Opinion of mine in the Signing and Swearing of this Treaty, Sir <hi>Fr. Cotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> your moſt worthy Servant, had acquainted me with all the diſpatch, and permitted me to Read the Papers over. Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt the 12 of <hi>July,</hi> the Council formerly warned to attend his Majeſty the next day at
<hi>Wanſted,</hi> were diſcharged, and ſome hour after my ſelf commanded to attend. Suſpecting thereupon I might be queſtioned, to that Effect I ſent for your Highneſs Secretary, and heard from him it would be ſo indeed, and that His Majeſty was much troubled and perplex'd about his Oaths. Preſently Town-Reports were Raiſed of great Oppoſition among the Lords againſt this Swearing. In ſo much as the ſhameleſs people had made two Orations, the one to be of mine for the Oaths, and the other of my Lord of <hi>Canterbury's</hi> againſt the ſame (which they ſuppoſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with the King, and the whole Councel) when neither of us had heard or ſpoken one word in that Theme. I ſpent in a manner all that Night in debating with my ſelf the Streights that your Highneſs was unto; and at the laſt fell upon this Reſolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Letter, which I deliver'd upon <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning in private to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49492:73"/>with an excuſe for my Boldneſs therein. His Majeſty accepted thereof very well, and Read it over three or four times that day, and ſeemed to me at that time to approve thereof in all Points, and put off further Diſcourſe till the Afternoon. I was ſo far em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned therewith, that after Dinner (becauſe I found ſome whiſpring among the Lords preſent) I ſtept again to His Majeſty, and deliver'd him an Opinion, that for the Oath of the Lords, his Majeſty ſhould not leave it to their Diſputation, but command them to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, there being no matter of ſcruple or moment in the ſame; as indeed there is not. This his Majeſty well approved of, and put in practiſe afterward, with good ſucceſs. The Council being met, whereof ſome were there by Reaſon of their Attendance, as my Lord Chamberlain, Earl of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> Lord <hi>Fenton,</hi> and Mr. Treaſurer, others warned, as the Duke, Lord<hi>Treaſurer,</hi> Lord <hi>Marſhal,</hi> my ſelf, Sir <hi>R. Weſton,</hi>and the two Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, his Majeſty made a Speech unto us full of perplexity, becauſe of your Highneſs's Streits, and his own Remorſe of Conſcience. Chiefly he inſiſted, it would be frivolous to be put upon it, to move the next Parliament to abrogate the Laws already Eſtabliſh'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Recuſants, which would not be Heard, much leſs Granted; and that in point of Conſcience and Religion, he could not promiſe, that no Laws hereafter ſhould be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. This his Majeſty, having utter'd with much Paſſion and earneſtneſs, left us to hear all the Papers Read, and having Commanded us very paſſionately to give him our beſt Advice, retired into his Chamber, and left us together for two hours. After the End of the Reading, many odd and extravagant Propoſitions were made of Advice, to be given to his Majeſty, how to get your Perſon home again; wherein I durſt not ſay one word, finding none of my Opinion (unleſs it were Secretary <hi>Calvert</hi>) nor my ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with any of theirs. At the laſt, preſſed thereunto, I ſaid, that I conceiv'd upon the Diſcourſe of his Majeſty, we could not deliver any Advice, or Opinion at all. For if his Majeſty made a Conſcience of taking the Oaths, and had already Framed unto himſelf this Concluſion, the immoveable Rule in this Caſe is, <hi>Quod dubitas ne feceris,</hi> nor there was no more in Policy, or Divinity to be ſaid therein. On the other ſide, if His Majeſty would otherwiſe declare himſelf, that he was not moved in Conſcience, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but only in Honour and Safety to Refuſe thoſe Oaths, I did hope no Lord in this Company would Adviſe his Majeſty to deſert his only Son, and to deſert him in this manner in the Face of all Chriſtiandom. For to pretend an excuſe to fetch him home, to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>his Majeſty to facilitate theſe Affairs, would never repair his Credit, who had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed that which his Father would not make good, nor was he himſelf any way able to accompliſh. Beſide that I made it a Queſtion, Whether the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> after all this wooing, would ſo eaſily be deceived in Licenſing him to depart. At the laſt his Majeſty Returning, and calling upon us for our Advice, all the Lords Aſſented to this laſt Opinion, and told his Majeſty, they durſt not Adviſe him any thing, until he expreſs'd himſelf more fully in the point of Conſcience. His Majeſty turning to me (whom he ſaid he had made for this time his Counſellor and Confeſſor) affirmed his Conſcience to ſtand, as he had ſaid before, but that he was willing to hear any thing that might move him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame. To the which, as far as I can remember, I ſpake in this manner.</p>

                        <p n="151">151. IT is not for me upon a ſudden to offer my Reaſons unto your Majeſty, to alter a Concluſion of Conſcience, once Reſolved on by your Majeſty, conſidering how Guilty I am both of mine own Greenneſs and Interruptions in theſe Studies, and of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties deep Learning, in that part of Divinity eſpecially. But becauſe I do conceive that your Majeſties doubting in this kind is an abſolute Condemnation of the Prince, who hath already Subſcribed, and Preſented theſe Oaths in their Perfection and Formalities to be taken by your Majeſty, and yet continueth (my Soul for his) as Zealous a Proteſtant as any Lives in the World (which his Majeſty by a ſhort Interruption did with Tears ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) I would preſume to ſay ſomewhat in defence of his Highneſs in this Caſe, tho I dare not be ſo bold as to apply or refer it to your Majeſty. Two things appear unto me conſiderable in this Caſe, the advancing of the True Religion, and the ſuppreſſing of the Adverſe within this Kingdom. The former is a matter directly of Conſcience, and your Majeſty is bound in Conſcience to take care of the ſame to the uttermoſt of your Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And if your Son had ſuffered (as he hath not) one Syllable to be inſerted into the Oaths or Articles derogating from the Religion Eſtabliſhed, he was worthily therein to be deſerted, and God to be by your Majeſty preferred before him. The ſuppreſſing of the Adverſe within this Kingdom, is to be conſider'd in two degrees; Firſt, <hi>Ita ut non praeſit.</hi>Secondly, <hi>Ita ut non ſit.</hi> For the firſt I think his Highneſs doth make it a matter of Religion and Conſcience, that Popery do not <hi>praeeſſe,</hi> prove ſo predominant in your Kingdoms, as that the Religion Eſtabliſh'd be thereby diſgraced, or dejected. For certain he makes it a Conſcience not to Erect <hi>Altare, contra altare.</hi> For as for the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49492:73"/>Leave he promiſeth for Strangers to be preſent at Divine Offices with the Family of the Infanta, it is <hi>per conniventiam,</hi> and as his Highneſs ſhall approve thereof. For the ſecond Degree, <hi>Ita ut non ſit,</hi> that the Popiſh Religion ſhould be quite extirpated, or the Penal Statutes for the ſuppreſſing the ſame, be ſtrictly Executed; His Highneſs dares not make this a matter of Conſcience and Religion, but a matter of State only. If the Prince ſhould make this a matter of Conſcience, he ſhould not only conclude the French King to be a falſe Catholic, for not ſuppreſſing the Proteſtants; and the Eſtates of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to be falſe Proteſtants for not ſuppreſſing the Papiſts at<hi>Amſterdam, Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and <hi>Utricht</hi> eſpecially, but ſhould conclude your Sacred Majeſty to have often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt your Conſcience (an horrible thought from ſuch a Son to ſuch a Father) becauſe your Papiſts are not ſuppreſſed, and your Penal Statutes have been ſo often intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and remitted. Theſe things you may well do, this Point continuing but a matter of State; but you may not do it, without committing a vaſh Sin, if now you ſhould ſtrein it up to a matter of Conſcience and Religion, againſt the Opinion of all moderate Divines, and the Practice of moſt States in Chriſtiandom, I conclude therefore, that his Highneſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving admitted nothing in theſe Oaths or Articles, either to the prejudice of the true, or the Equalizing, or Authorizing of the other Religion, but contained himſelf wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Limits of Penal Statutes, and connivences, wherein the Eſtate hath ever Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and Uſurped a directing Power, hath Subſcribed no one Paper of all theſe againſt his own, nor (I profeſs it openly) againſt the Dictamen of my Conſcience. As ſoon as I had ended, the King ſpake Largely and Chearfully, <hi>That in Conſcience he was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. </hi> To which the Lords likewiſe as generally, gave their Applauſe. So the reſt of the Counſel were Summon'd againſt the next <hi>Sunday,</hi> the Arch-biſhop of<hi>Canterbury,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Hamilton,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Worceſter, </hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon,</hi> the Lord<hi>Cary,</hi> the Lord <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> with others whom I may have forgot. And all was diſpatch'd before the Embaſſadors, as I need not to relate; becauſe Sir<hi>Fr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington</hi> can beſt do it.

So powerful and perſpicuous was the Lord Keeper's Theology, that all the Worthies of <hi>David,</hi> his Majeſties Secret Counſel, concurr'd in the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Among whom was Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Torturer of the beſt Roman Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion with his mighty Learning. Another was Archbiſhop <hi>Abbots,</hi> about whom Mr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> is moſt negligently miſtaken, to write thus, <hi>Pag.</hi> 550. <hi>That he was then ſuſpended from his Function, and from coming to the Council-Table.</hi> He ſat that Day with the Lords, and was the firſt that ſubſcribed in the Catalogue, as himſelf obſerves. It may be Mr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi> could not reconcile, (nor I neither) how he ſhould ſign to the Ratification, and undertake a long Letter to King <hi>James</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it with many Flouriſhes, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 13. <hi>The ſame Fountain cannot ſend forth ſalt Water and freſh,</hi> Jam. 3.12. Therefore I deny the Letter, (I believe juſtly) to have been written by him. Such Frauds are committed daily, to ſet Credit to ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Writings under a borrowed Name. <hi>A. Gell.</hi> picks out a fit Merchant for ſuch Ware, <hi>Sertorius,</hi> a brave Commander, but a great Impoſtor. <hi>Literas Compoſitas pro veris legebat,</hi> Lib. 15. Cap. 22. But I will prove my Conjecture ſtrongly. Firſt, So wiſe a Man would not ſhame himſelf with Inconſtancy; Act one thing to Day with his Sovereign Lord, and pluck it down to Morrow. Secondly, The Letter crept out of Darkneſs Thirty Years after the Prince came out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Twenty Years after the ſuppoſed Authors Death. A large time to hatch a Fable. Thirdly, The Lord Keeper, <hi>(vide ſupra)</hi> certified the Prince, that before the Lords came together to conſult about the eaſe of the Oaths, two Speeches were in many Hands riſe in <hi>London;</hi> The one for the Negative, under the Archbiſhop's Name; The other for the Affirmative, under the Lord Keepers Name, when no Colloquy had been begun about it. Was it not as eaſie for the ſame Author, or ſuch another, to forge a Letter, as well as a Speech? Fourthly, The Archbiſhop was ſo ſtout in the Pulpit at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> as to deplore the Prince's abſence, and his departure out of the Kingdom. The ill reliſh of that paſſage, (I know it by the Papers under my Hand) was ſent abroad as far as <hi>Spain</hi> by Sir <hi>Edw. Villiers.</hi> And I dare ſay the Tydings of that Letter, had followed the News of the Sermon, if it had been a Chicken of the ſame Brood. Finally, There was nothing done that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49492:74"/>needed a Recantation. Yet Opinions were ſo various, that ſome ſpread it for a Fame, That the Prince himſelf gave the Lord Keeper no Thanks for his Labour. But that which follows will encounter it, to break the Chaw-bone of the Lye; as it is to be found in a Poſtſcript of his to the Duke, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 85.</p>

And a Prince will find it true, that he gets as many Hearts, when he receives the Devoirs of his Subjects comfortably and ſmilingly, as when he rewards them bountifully.

One Man's Wit wrought Miracles here to ſoder up all the broken pieces of the buſineſs. Though the Prince had skilful Men about him, yet there wanted ſuch another Head-piece at his Elbow in <hi>Spain.</hi> I cannot but think of him, when I remember what <hi>Cuiacius</hi> ſaid of his great Maſter in the <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Law, <hi>Nemo unus erit unquam Papinianus.</hi> Neither let his Praiſe fall lower, becauſe he was not a <hi>Neſtor</hi> in Years: For he was elder at this time, than <hi>Papinian</hi> was when he died. He followed the Cares of the Prince in <hi>Madrid,</hi> when his Imployment was call'd for, but being far off, not altogether with the like ſucceſs. It was hot Weather now in that Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Climate, the <hi>Bocca Difurno,</hi> as they call it; and the Treaty of the Match was not a little ſcorch'd.

The Ratification of the Articles was ready to be publiſh'd by the Nuncio after much ado: But the Pope dies <hi>July</hi> 8. <hi>Benè fecit Regulus quod mortuus eſt, melius ſi ante,</hi> ſays <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Ep. ad Arn.</hi> But well had it been, if old <hi>Gregory</hi> had lived lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or died ſooner. The Life of his Diſpenſation and Confirmations expired with him. All the Ground we had trod muſt be trod over again; and we are carried back to the beginning of the Race, from whence we ſtarted: And no coming for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, no not a foot, till St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair was fill'd again. Whoſe Succeſſor was not choſen till <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 6th. Nor he at leiſure to mind this Matter in his new Pontificality till <hi>September.</hi> Nor a ſecond Impreſſion of a Diſpenſation to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, till <hi>November</hi> even ſpent. Who would not have conſider'd the Diſdain that a generous Love, and a more generous Mind, muſt conceive, to have the Cherry bob at his Lip, and to be ſnatcht from him? <hi>Quo propiùs acceſſeris ad ſpem fruendi, hòc impatientius careas,</hi> ſays the ſame <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. But let a free born Spirit ſee what it is to wait upon the Papal Pleaſure, ſo lingring, ſo imperious, I know not which is worſt. Chriſtianity bids us <hi>ſubmit to them which watch over our Souls,</hi> Heb. 13. but it doth not make us Religious Slaves. Therefore the Prince declar'd it for his reſolute Mind, That he would not abide the delay of the next Miſſive from <hi>Rome,</hi> nor ſtay for the Birth of another Elephant: Neither ſhould all the <hi>Syrens</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> ſtop his departure. Which made them whiſper, That his Highneſs would rob them of his Company, and take no leave; and ſet ſome, though not openly, to keep Centinel to prevent him. Which ſurmiſe he confronted with a Meſſage, equal to the beſt of the ancient Apophthegms, That though he came thither pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily out of Love, he ſcorn'd to ſteal away privily out of Fear. But when he heard that ſome were ſet in ambuſh to interrupt his Return, he bore it Heroically, and without ſtrife of Paſſion, becauſe he knew no Remedy to help it, and wrote to the King his Father to be couragious in the ſufferance with theſe Lines: <q>That if his Majeſty ſhould receive any Intelligence, that he was deteined in that State as a Priſoner, he would be pleaſed, for his ſake, never to think of him more as a Son, but to reflect with all Royal Thoughts upon the good of his Siſter, and the ſafety of his own Kingdoms.</q> That Family, and thoſe Children, with whom King <hi>Philip</hi> held leſs Amity than with the Engliſh, ſecur'd us afterwards from thoſe fears. But for other things, the Grandees of the <hi>Conſulto</hi> (till their heat had vapoured out) ſtood upon ſuch Terms, as had no Equity or Moderation. For when Sir <hi>Fr. Cottington</hi> return'd with our Kings Oath, plighted to the annexed Conditions for the eaſe of the Roman Catholicks, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made no Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of Joy, (ſays the Prince in his Report) or of an ordinary liking to it. Therefore the Lord Keeper obſerving that they had an inſatiate and hydropical Malady, that the more they gulpt down the more they thirſted, he tried if they would take this Julip as he prepared it in his Letter to the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

                           <hi>I</hi> Have Received yours of the 8 of <hi>July</hi>by the Lord <hi>Andover,</hi> and heartily thank your Grace for the News, though not ſo compleatly good, as we deſir'd; yet better then for many days together I expected; beſide the hope I retain it may ſtill be better; His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Lords have taken the Oaths, and the Laws againſt the Roman Catholicks are actually ſuſpended (as upon my Credit and Honeſty they were a good while before;) Now <hi>July, Auguſt, September,</hi>and a piece of <hi>October</hi> are left for a further Probation. This being ſo, what good will it do that Wiſe and Great Eſtate, to Publiſh to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andom their diffidence of ſo juſt a Prince, eſpecially being Sworn, and Depoſed. Your Grace knoweth very well (I would the State of <hi>Spain</hi> knew as much) that all our Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt Recuſants is at our Aſſiſes, which are holden at this inſtant, and do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again till after the firſt of <hi>March:</hi> So as all the probate of the ſuſpenſion of the Laws againſt them, betwixt this and the firſt of<hi>March,</hi> will be ſeen and diſcerned by the laſt of our <hi>Auguſt.</hi> For between that and the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> there can be no Trial at all. I know if this were underſtood in that place, it were unanſwerable. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the King's-Bench, which only can be objected, are altogether depending upon Indictments at the Aſſiſes; ſo that the Spring once ſtopt (as now it is) theſe Rivers grow Dry, and run no more. This will mollifie all Stubborneſs, which is Reſolv'd to ſtoop to Reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:49492:75"/>Juſt at this time the Days of Trouble look'd darker and darker in <hi>Spain.</hi> The Prince, diſguſted to Treat with a People that ask'd much and granted little; and Wire-drew Counſels into Vexatious length, reſolv'd to take his leave: and ſhew'd the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his Fathers Royal and Indiſpenſable Pleaſure, that no Proffer ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, but that he ſhould haſten him, for which his Navy did attend him upon the Coaſt of <hi>Biſcay.</hi> That it was no fault of his that he muſt depart when the Treaty was ſo imperfect, but in them that made it a <hi>Juſtitium,</hi> or Intermiſſion of all Proceedings, becauſe upon the Death of the Pope, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was not open. <hi>Olivarez</hi> to divert his Highneſs, made Two Propoſitions; Firſt, That the Prince would come in to the Conditions as they came formerly from <hi>Rome,</hi> or to ſtay till new ones might be agreed upon, and Ratified at <hi>Rome; Hoc illud cornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copiae eſt, ubi in eſt quicquid volo,</hi> ſays <hi>Pſeudolus in Plautus.</hi> Grant the Conde to make his Reference to <hi>Rome,</hi> and you grant him all. That's the Goats-Horn, or Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers Box, out of which he can fetch any thing with a ſleight. The Prince an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him very gravely for one ſo young, (as he made the Report at <hi>St. James</hi>'s) The firſt motion he had declin'd before, neither had he chang'd his Judgment; nor ſhould they find him a <hi>Shechem,</hi> to paſs over into a New Religion for a Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. The other Motion he accepted this way, He would go for <hi>England</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Articles there, and let them do the like at <hi>Rome. Olivarez</hi> admired at his Reply, but took it up with this Anſwer, That to be gone ſo ſoon, and nothing Model'd to the Content of any ſide, would be a Breach; therefore he humbly beſought his Highneſs to ſtay but Twenty Days, and he ſwore by all the Saints of Heaven, then he was ſure it would be a Marriage. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſtanding by, ſaid, It is well, but it might have been as well Seven years ago: Which put the Conde to a great Anger, and in his Anger made him Fome out a Secret, That there was no Match intended Seven Months ago; and ſays he, I will fetch that out of my Desk that ſhall aſſure you of it. So he produced a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, written to one Don <hi>Baltaſar,</hi> with King <hi>Philip</hi> III. his own Hand, as he Vowed. The Prince was allowed to Read it then as much as he would, but not to take a Copy, (all this was declared to the next Parliament in the Banquetting-Houſe:) His Highneſs, with Sir <hi>Wal. Aſton,</hi> better Skill'd in the Caſtilian Language, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated the Letter, as their Memories would bear it away, and kept it for a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is the Letter which I think Mr. <hi>Prinn</hi> was the firſt that divulged, out of the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi>'s Papers, which he had Ranſack'd. Whether it were a true Letter of King <hi>Philip</hi>'s lies upon <hi>Olivarez</hi> Credit, (it never came out of his Cuſtody) or whether the Prince and Sir <hi>W. Aſton</hi> miſt nothing of the right Senſe of it, through Frailty of Memory, when they came to Recollect the Sum of it in private, is not yet decided. <hi>Salomon</hi> alluding to the Contradictions that are in ſome Mens Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſays, <hi>They are like the Legs of the Lame, that are not equal,</hi> Prov. 26.7. Let the beſt Bone-ſetter in the Hundred ſet theſe Legs even if he can. An Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical Notary in <hi>Spain,</hi> Conde <hi>Olivarez</hi> ſhews it under Black and White, that <hi>Philip,</hi> the Father of the Infanta, who died <hi>Anno</hi> 1621, held our King in Hopes, but never intended to give his Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> Hear the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the other ſide: His Highneſs Remembred the Parliament, That Sir <hi>Wal. Aſton</hi> was ſtruck Mute at the Reading of the Letter; for upon the Death of the late King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being ſent from his Maſter our Soveraign to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> that now is, to underſtand his Mind upon the Treaty of Marriage; he receiv'd this Chearful Anſwer, <hi>That he was ſorry he had not the Honour to begin it, but now he would purſue it with all Alacrity.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> is another Witneſs, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 27. I inſiſted that Two Millions for the Portion were by the laſt King ſettled, and agreed with me. That this King had undertaken to purſue the Buſineſs as it was left by his Father, and to make Good whatſoever he had promiſed; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I deſired that the Original Papers and Conſultoes of the laſt King might be ſeen; which very honeſtly by the Secretary <hi>Cirica</hi> were produced; and appeared to be ſuch, that I dare ſay there was not any Man that ſaw them, that doubteth of the laſt Kings real Intention of making the Match: So I leave theſe Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to bluſh at the ſight of one another: But to me, <hi>Olivarez</hi> his Fidelity is the Leg that halts. For as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid of <hi>Roſcius,</hi> the Comoedians Adverſary, <hi>Quod ſibi probare non poſſit, id perſuadere alteri conatur,</hi> he could never perſuade that vigorouſly to another which he disbelieved himſelf. It is a tedious thing to be tied to Treat with one that cares not for his own Honour, nor regards his Modeſty with whom he Treats. I mean that ſame Perſon, that Baſhaw of King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Conde Duke, who entramel'd as many Devices as his Pate could bring together, to raiſe a Duſt; and made Demands meerly to ſatisfie his own Pride, that he might boaſt he had
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49492:75"/>ask'd them, though his diſcretion taught him that he could never obtain them. When Sir <hi>Fr. Cottington</hi> return'd to <hi>Madrid</hi> with the great Article, procur'd to ſuſpend the Penal Statutes of <hi>England</hi> in favour of Recuſants, he preſented it to the <hi>Conde,</hi> and expected, as the <hi>Caſttlian</hi> Phraſe is, <hi>Las Albricias,</hi> a reward for bringing of good News; the <hi>Conde</hi> ſtoop'd not ſo low as to give Thanks; but, having peruſed the Paper, told Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> it would be expected the Prince ſhould Negotiate a plain Toleration; for the Proteſtants that endured that which was in his Hand, would patiently endure more. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> Anſwered him with the Old Simile, <hi>That his Lordſhip was no good Muſician, for he would peg the</hi> Minikin <hi>ſo high, till it crack'd.</hi> Concerning his Attemptings upon the Prince, my ſupply is out of private Letters that came from Friend to Friend. The <hi>Conde</hi> had Oblig'd his Honour to his Highneſs, when he came Firſt to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> never to meddle with him about his Religion. He kept not his promiſe; but ſolicited his Highneſs, that as he lov'd his Soul, he would return to <hi>England</hi> a Catholic in his Senſe. <hi>Well my Lord,</hi> ſays the Prince, <hi>You have broken your Word with me, but I will not break my Faith with God.</hi> Another time he beſought his Highneſs to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his Company at a Solemn Maſs; <hi>No Sir,</hi> ſays the Prince, <hi>I will do no ill, nor the ſuſpicion of it.</hi> Once more this <hi>Idern</hi> told his Highneſs, that he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all that he could deſire from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> if he would profeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Son of the Roman Church; he ſhould not only carry home the braveſt Lady for Beauty, Birth, and Vertue that was; but be made as great a King in Riches and Power as was in <hi>Europe.</hi> But as the Prophet ſays, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.5. <hi>Excan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcentia mea fulcivit me,</hi> my Fury it upheld me; ſo the Prince was heated at the Offer, and gave this provocation to him that had provok'd him, that it was ſuch a another Rhadomontade, as the Devil made to Chriſt, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and Worſhip me.</hi> Next to matters of Religion, the ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thing that was tugg'd for in this Month, was about the Reſtitution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate. The Secretary of the Elector came to <hi>Madrid</hi> with Letters to the Duke about it, which were not firſt imparted to the King his Father-in-Law. But all that ſhall be drawn up into one Proceſs in the Tranſactions of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>

                  <p n="155">155. But in all Diſputes for Sacred or ſecular Matters, the Miniſters of our King were the more Naked and Unarm'd, when they came to the puſh of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Subtleties, becauſe they kept not the correſpondence with themſelves. If my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> could have faſhion'd his mind to draw the ſame yoke with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who was moſt converſant upon the place, and beſt knew the Arts of that Nation, ſucceſs had been more Fortunate. But thoſe Civil Diſcords were the Cauſe of many diſorders and incivilities. Therefore the King impoſed on the Lord Keeper, to uſe his Pen once more to reconcile them, which he did not fail to do the very next day, which was his Majeſties Remove to begin the Weſtern Progreſs.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Grace,</p>
                  <p>I <hi>would not be troubleſom with this Second Letter, but chiefly to let your Grace know, that you never stood in your Life more uprightly in his Majeſties Favour, then at this inſtant; and that I ſhall need to pour out no other Prayers unto God, but for the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame. For Gods ſake Write to my Lord</hi> Hamilton, <hi>and acquaint his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with ſome Paſſages of your Affairs. For my ſelf I ſhall be content to Rove, and gueſs at them. And I hope your Grace will be pleaſed to pardon this Excurſion, that is my running this ſecond or third time into buſineſs, which I am told (but cannot by any means believe it) hath already drawn your Grace's Offence againſt me. It is a moſt Humble, Zealous, and earneſt Petition to your Grace, to Seal up, and really confirm that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reconciliation, which to the great Contentment of all your Friends (but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of ſome among us) you have made with the Earl of</hi> Briſtol. <hi>What I wrote for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly might be ill placed, and offend your Grace; but all proceeded from as true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere a Heart unto your Grace, as you left behind you in all this Kingdom. But the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it now again hath a Root from a higher Power, who hath obſerv'd your Grace his Favour ſo abounding towards me; and my acknowledgments, ſo far as my poor ability permitteth, ſo returned to your Grace, that he was pleaſed to ſay unto me this Morning, upon this Theme, That he knew you would regard any Repreſentation that I ſhould recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you. In good Faith his Majeſty is more then Zealous, not only of fair Terms of Friendſhip, but of a near Alliance, formerly ſpoken of, between your Grace, and that Earl. Of whoſe Sufficiencies and Abilities I perceive His Majeſty to retein an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary good Opinion; which in all Humility I thus leave to your Lordſhips Wiſdom and Conſideration.</hi>

The Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> had heard how the Lord Keeper had ventur'd to make this Pacification, and writes to him, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 20. <hi>That the Friendſhip of the Duke was a thing he did infinitely deſire, that he did much Eſteem the good Offices his Lordſhip bad done therein, but that he conceived that any motion he had made in that kind, had been deſpis'd, rather then received with Thankfulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="156">156. He might have ſaid more then deſpiſed; for they were received with that ſad Interpretation, that upon it the Duke removed his Affections from the Lord Keeper for ever; quite contrary to <hi>Solon's</hi> Rule, neither to chooſe a Friend ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, nor to looſe him ſuddenly. But after all the Lord Keepers Faithfulneſs, and that he watch'd the good of the Dukes Affairs in his abſence, with as much tenderneſs, as a Nurſe doth a ſucking Child at her Breaſt, his Grace reſolv'd to pluck down the higheſt Roof of his Dignity, as ſoon as he could. Nor was he the ſurer to eſcape that Anger for fair Words. <hi>Tacitae magis &amp; occultae inimicitiae timendae ſunt, quàm indictae &amp; apertae.</hi> Cic. 7. Verrin. Yet the threatning broke out by one man, who was glad to cheriſh it. For Sir <hi>John Michel</hi> did not hide it, that my Lord <hi>Mandevile,</hi> Lord Preſident of the Councel, ſhew'd him a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Spain,</hi> aſſuring that the firſt Action the Duke would Embark himſelf in when he came home, ſhould be to remove him out of his Place, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 89. With which the threatned party was not much daunted, knowing what a Maſter he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that King, whoſe Speech utter'd at <hi>Sterling</hi> at fourteen years of Age, hath Wiſdom becoming one of fourty, <hi>Spotwoods p.</hi> 288. <q>I will ſtudy to be indifferent and to beſtow my Favours impartially, and never repoſe my ſelf upon any one ſo much, as to deny others the regard that is due unto them.</q> The Duke was a generous, and incorrupt Patron; an exactor of great Duty from thoſe he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, or a great Enemy. Let him allow himſelf what he could ask for all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, this Man was ready to pay him. If he would be deceiv'd by crafty Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminers into the diſtruſt of his trueſt Friend, when he could not ſerve him in unfit ways, the fault is in the want of his Grace's inſight, or inconſtancy. But as I find it in the Poſthumous Meditation of the moſt Noble Lord <hi>Capel, p.</hi> 21. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is a fine Thred, which will ſcarce hold one tug of a crafty Tale-bearer. The <hi>Obſervator</hi> on <hi>H. L.</hi> lights upon this Quarrel (I do not purſue the Lord Keepers Enemies: But if I meet them I will not ſhun them) Thus, <hi>He being Drunk with Wormwood;</hi> Lam. 3.15. That he had done many ill Offices to the Duke, when he was in <hi>Spain p.</hi> 36. Many? and yet Name none? If he will pick his Ears clean from the filth of Hatred, I will tell him what my Lord Duke took to be ill Offices. The Firſt Diſpleaſure (and never laid down) was, That the knowledge came to the King by his means, who thoſe Gentlemen were, that importun'd his Grace by their Expreſſes ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> to rend the Treaty of the Match in ſunder, or to Act againſt it with all Wit and Power. The accuſed Lord proteſted upon his Salvation he was not the Diſcoverer. The acclearment is fair, and the Proof nothing; who is able to make Anſwer to Jealouſie, that grows out of the Mud of a man's Brain, like a Bull-ruſh? I will Relate what the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> the Duke's Father-in-Law, return'd again, when he had gone between them often to diſmount this Objection; that the Duke ſaid, <hi>Whenſoever I Diſagree with him, he will prove himſelf to be in the Right; and though I could never detect him hitherto to be Diſhoneſt, I am afraid of his Wit.</hi> The Second Offence taken was, That he would have perſwaded the Duke into a good Opinion of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; becauſe he would have kept his Lordſhip in a good Opinion with the King. To which all his Allies, all that Studied him, all that Honour'd him, did not contribute ſo much, nor had the King's Ear ſo much as he had to effect it. To ſit <hi>Heraclides</hi> his Adagy to him, <hi>Nemo benè merito bovem immolavit, praeter Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> He was another <hi>Pharias,</hi> that offered the beſt Sacrifice to that Lord, that had deſerved the beſt of him. When I find the King had his part in that which was ſo ill taken anent the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I can find no blame in it. But if it had been an Error, it was a ſanctified one, to labour to convert Enmities unto Love unfeigned. And ſhould a Talent of Anger be weighed againſt a Grain of Offence? There was no Error; there was no Offence, but that Infelicity which the Wiſe Man <hi>Bias</hi> obſerv'd to be in ſuch Caſes. <q>That it is better to be Judg in a Cauſe between two Enemies, then two Friends; for of two Friends I ſhall make one mine Enemy; but of two Enemies it is likely I ſhall make one my Friend; <hi>Laert in vità.</hi>
                     </q> The Third Scandal was, That he ſet forward the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Marriage with Oars, and Sails of Ingeny and Induſtry. A new Crime <hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> and never heard before. He was a Servant in it. He was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49492:76"/>unto the Care of it by the King; and he was as Truſty to it, as the Soul of his Majeſty could wiſh. The beſt Head-piece of our Councel in <hi>Spain</hi> look'd upon him as the chief Adjutant, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 23. Thus the Earl of <hi>Briſtol:</hi> 
                     <q>If there ſhould be any doubt, I am ſure that your Lordſhip would put to a helping hand, to keep the buſineſs from being overthrown, ſince you have done ſo much for the overcoming of former difficulties, and the bringing it to the paſs it is now in.</q> The Duke was fallen, by the wylineſs of others, and by his own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, into a contrary Motion; when the Lord Keeper ſaw the Councils of his greateſt Friend eſloigned from thoſe of his dread Sovereign, he had been a Beaſt if he had not given the Right Hand to Loyalty. <hi>Patrem primum, poſtea Patronum proximum nomen habere,</hi> ſays <hi>Cato</hi> in <hi>A.

But it began with diſcontent on every ſide, and never mended. Our Wiſe King no longer ſmother'd his Paſſion, but confeſs'd at ſundry times a great fault in himſelf, that he had been ſo improvident, to ſend the Duke on this Errand with the Prince, whoſe bearing in <hi>Spain</hi> was ill Report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all that were not partial. He put the bafful ſo affectedly upon the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> at every turn, that thoſe Propoſitions which his Majeſty had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore approved with deep Wiſdom, and ſetled with the Word of Honour, were ſtruck out by my Lord of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> only becauſe <hi>Briſtol</hi> had preſented them. Nay, if the Prince began to qualifie the unreaſonableneſs, he would take the Tale out of his Highneſs's Mouth, and over-rule it; and with ſuch youthful and capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Geſtures, as became not the lowly Subjection due to ſo great a Perſon, but leaſt of all before Strangers. It was an Eye-ſore to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> above any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſpeak not to their King, and the Royal Stems of the Crown, without the Complement of Reverence; nor approach unto them without a kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration. The more the Prince endur'd it, the more was their judgment againſt it. For every Mouth was fill'd with his Highneſs's Praiſe, and nothing thought wanting in him to be abſolutely good and Noble, but to know his own Birth and Majeſty better, and to keep more diſtance from a Subject. So the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> Writes <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 20. <q>I proteſt as a Chriſtian, I never heard in all the time of his being here, nor ſince, any one Exception againſt him, unleſs it were for being ſuppoſed to be too much guided by my Lord of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> which was no Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sin in their cenſure.</q> For how much their gall Super-abounded againſt that Lord, the ſame Earl could not hold to write it to the Lord Keeper, bearing Date <hi>Auguſt</hi> 20. <q>I know not how things may be Reconciled here before my Lord Duke's departure, but at preſent they are in all Extremity ill, betwixt this King, his Miniſters, and the Duke. And they ſtick not to profeſs, that they will rather put the Infanta head-long into a Well, then into his Hands.</q> One thing that fill'd up the Character of my Lord Duke before in this Work was, that he had much of the brave <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in him: In this they differ; that <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſuited himſelf ſo well, to the Manners and Cuſtoms of all Courts, where he came, that he gave ſatisfaction to all Princes; and they were beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, that moſt enjoy'd him. The great Lord <hi>Villiers</hi> was not ſo Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; for he thrived not in the Air of <hi>Madrid;</hi> and he brook'd the Air of <hi>Paris</hi> as ill, about two years after upon the like Occaſion.

                     <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> had Noted his Lordſhips Errors, and unbeſeeming Pranks before. For which he look'd for no better, then he that rubs a Horſe that is gaul'd. Yet he reſolv'd to ſhoot another Arrow the ſame way, that the former went; though the Duke had threatned to break his Bow as ſoon as he came Home. But he was too prudent to be ſcared from doing Duty to ſo great a Friend. <gap reason="foreign">

Nevertheleſs, to draw out the Thread of Favour to more length, which the Duke had with the King, and that the Deſtinies might not cut it off, the Lord Keeper wrote to his Majeſty upon Sir <hi>John Hipſley</hi>'s Arrival in the midſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> That he had heard more of the Duke's moſt laudable Diligence in <hi>Spain,</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:49492:77"/>from Sir <hi>John,</hi> than ever he could learn before; that Malice it ſelf could not but commend his Zeal, and that Humanity could not but pity the Toil he had, to reduce that intricate and untoward Buſineſs of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> to ſome good Succeſs. He might well call them intricate and untoward, for the Spaniſh Motions were circular Nothings, much about, and nothing to the Point. Moſt true it is, that the Articles anent the Marriage were drawn up, and reſtricted to ſome Heads and Numbers (though not perfected) three years before the Emperor had entred into the <hi>Palz</hi> with any Hoſtility. Therefore the Spaniards diſputed thus; Bring not the motion of it into this Treaty, as a thing born out of due time. What were it elſe, but, as the Proverb ſays, <hi>Extra chorum ſaltare,</hi> to Dance well, but quite out of the meaſure of the <hi>Maſcarata?</hi> We anſwered, if things had been, as they are now, at the beginning, this had then been a principal Capitulation. Nor had we honerated the Articles with a new Propoſition, unleſs themſelves, that is, the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> had caſt us into the Gulph of a new Extremity. Reduce the King and his Poſterity to the ſame Peace they were in, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to treat, and we ask no more. But as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de ben. c.</hi> 35. <hi>Omnia eſſe debent eadem quae fuerant cum promitterem, ut promittentis fidem teneas.</hi> But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo great a Change, there is neither Inconſtancy, nor Encroachment, to fall into new Conſultations. For all this, though nothing but Pertinacy durſt ſtand the Breath of ſo much Truth, the others came no nearer to us, but kept further off, affirming (as it is in the Report made at St. <hi>James</hi>'s) that they conceived our King expected no Reſtitution at all for his Son and Daughter, and that they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Majeſty had already digeſted that bitter Potion. We told them, they muſt not diſſemble before us, as if they knew not the Contrary. For his Majeſty never intermitted to rouſe up their Embaſſadors to give him a fair Anſwer about it; and had ſtopt the Treaty of the Match, if they had not opened the Way by Proteſtation made in the Faith of their King, that the <hi>Palatinate</hi> ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up with Peaceable Poſſeſſion. What Shape could <hi>Olivarez</hi> put on now? none but his own: a ſtately Impudency. For he told us in the broad Day-light, that all former Promiſes, ſpoken before the Prince's Coming, whether by Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to our King, or by <hi>Count Gondamar,</hi> to my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> and others, were but <hi>Palabras de cumplimiento,</hi> Gratifications of fine Words, but no more to be taken hold of, than the Fables and Fictions of <hi>Greece</hi> before the Wars of <hi>Theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> The Prince came over him at this with a blunt Anger, that if there were no more Aſſurance in their Word, it was paſt the Wit of Man to know what they meant; but he would tell them really his Father's, and his own Meaning, That without his Siſter's, and her Husband's Inheritance reſtored, they neither intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marriage nor Friendſhip. When King <hi>Philip</hi> had heard with what Courage and Determination his Highneſs had ſpoken, like <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Velleius, Se virtute ſuâ, non magnitudine hoſtium metiens,</hi> it put that King and his Counſel to a middle-way, as they called it, To treat upon the old Articles, and no other, as falling perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly on the Marriage, but to take into a concurrent Deliberation, the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Prince Elector's Country. Let Metaphyſical States-men ſcratch their Heads, and find a real Diſtinction, if they can, between theſe Formalities. Yet Sir <hi>Walter Aſton</hi> followed them in that Way, and paid them in the ſame Coin with this Diſtinction, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 38. <hi>That the King his Maſter preſt for the Reſtitution of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>and Electoral Dignity to the Prince, his Son-in-Law, not as a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Marriage, but to be ſetled together with the Marriage</hi>—And again, <hi>Not as a Condition, but as a Fruit and Bleſſing of the Alliance—And to make the Coming of the Excellent Princeſs, the Infanta, of more Eſteem to his Subjects, bringing with her (beſide the Glory of her own Virtue and Worth) the Security of a perpetual Peace and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi> Theſe were Punctilio's in Honour, but juſt Nothings in Wiſdom; the Cauſe of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> muſt not be tempered at the ſame Forge, but apart, not a Ruſh was gotten by it, and time waſted; for our Miniſters were reſolved to conclude neither, unleſs they perfected both.</p>
                  <p n="160">160. The Sennor <hi>Duca Olivarez</hi> made ſuch Work upon this Theme, and turn'd it into ſo many Forms, that it makes him ridiculous in the Hiſtory,

The Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there was nothing really intended on the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Part, but that the Treaty was entertained only till he (and the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>) had reduced
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49492:78"/>
                     <hi>Germany</hi> into their Power, which might be ſuſpected without Injury, by looking upon this <hi>Vertumnus</hi> in all his Changings. Seven Months before the Prince took his Journey, and came to caſt the Die upon the whole Stake, to win or looſe all, Mr. <hi>End. Porter</hi> was ſent to <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſpake with the great Conde, who ſnapt him up, and gave him this unkind Welcome in a Chaſe, <hi>That they neither meant the Match, nor the Reſtitution of the</hi> Palatinate. Preſently the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> gave him a Viſit, and a Diſcourſe about it: In a trice he winds himſelf out of his former Fury, and vows he would do his beſt to further both. The next Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very breaks out by Mr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s Diligence, <hi>Pag.</hi> 540. in a Letter of the Conde's to King <hi>Philip, Novemb.</hi> 8. 1622. <hi>That the King of</hi> Great Brittain <hi>affected the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Son with the Infanta, and was more engaged for the</hi> Palatinate—<hi>And as a Maxim, I hold theſe two Engagements in him to be inſeparable—For us, though we make the Marriage, we muſt fail in the other—Then you will be forced to a War with</hi> England, <hi>with which, all Convenencies, that were formerly thought upon, will ceaſe.</hi> The Remedy which he propounds, to fail without all theſe Shelves, I never did light upon out of this Letter. 'Tis thus—<hi>The Emperor, as your Majeſty knows by his Embaſſador, deſires to Marry his Daughter with the King of</hi> England'<hi>s Son; and I doubt not but he will be glad to Marry his Second Daughter to the</hi> Palatine's <hi>Son—So all the Conventencies of Alliance will be as full in this—For it accommodates the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the</hi> Palatinate, <hi>and the Succeſſion of his Grand-Children without Blood or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> Here is a new Bride appointed for his Highneſs, the eldeſt Daughter of the Emperor, which is unlikely to be intended, becauſe it comes from none but ſuch an Author as <hi>Olivarez,</hi> and in as much as when Count <hi>Suartzenburg</hi> came about eighteen Months before Embaſſador to our King from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> this was not mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that Oportunity, and when the Prince came to <hi>Spain,</hi> no ſhadow of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, but it was vaniſhed like a Morning-miſt before the Sun. Now follow their Whimſies and their In and Outs at the Conſulto, when the Prince was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. The firſt Onſet that <hi>Olivarez</hi> gave, was, <q>That they were ready to follow all the Demands of the King of <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> concerning the Match for his Son; to the Demands for his Son-in-Law, he ſaid, they were not in their Power to effect, his Country was extended upon by the Emperor, his Electoral Dignity inveſted in the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                     </q> And within this Charm they kept us long, till we were weary with their Obſtinacy, and ſate down a while, as when Boys Scourge a great Top till they make it ſleep. At laſt, the Prince's Highneſs, offended that he could gain nothing by this Alliance for his dear Siſter's Good, offered to give King <hi>Philip</hi> a Farewel, that he might look timely at Home for the Relief of her Miſery. On this, no man courts his Highneſs to ſtay, ſo much as <hi>Olivarez;</hi> and to ſlacken his Return, revives the Conſult of the Reſtitution, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth the ſtrongeſt Mediation that the King his Maſter could make with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts and Bavarians; which if it were rejected (but they hoped better) he would be forward, for his Part, to ſtir up his Catholick Majeſty to give his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the King of <hi>England,</hi> Aſſiſtance by Arms, to procure him his Satisfaction. Yet, whatſoever he ſaid, his Heart lay a thought farther, and he had a Trick to redeem himſelf out of this Promiſe; for he told his Highneſs, in a Weeks ſpace after, that he found their Nation ſo linked to the Love of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> that they would never march chearfully into the Field againſt it. For all this the Weather-cock turn'd, and he was affrighted in a moment into a good Mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. So did his Highneſs report at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, that a falſe Alarum being brought to <hi>Madrid,</hi> that Count <hi>Tilly,</hi> with his whole Body of Foot and Horſe, was routed in <hi>Germany,</hi> inſtantly the Conde Duke came, with as much Fear as Haſt, unto the Prince, and with as much Lowlineſs as his Knee upon the Ground, vowed he would give him a Blank for the Reſtitution of the Palſgrave's Intereſt; but when the Second (that is, the worſt) News came, that the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> was quite defeated, the Mood was changed with the Man, and he ſpake as loftily from that Matter, as if the great Armada had been failing again upon our Brittiſh Ocean. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to how many Paces did Hipocriſie put him? Sincerity would have got him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, diſpatch the Work, and ſaved him all this Trouble; for with the ſame Study, nay, with far leſs, men may attain to be ſuch as they ought to be, which they miſ-ſpend, in ſeeking to be ſuch as they are not, <hi>Quibus id perſuaſum eſt, ut nihil mallent ſe eſſe quàm bonos viros, iis reliquam facilem eſſe doctrinam Cic. de orat. lib.</hi> 3. After that great <hi>Don Jaſper</hi> had put himſelf to the Expence of all this Folly, he riveted in two Straws more like than Wedges, to cleave the Knot. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let the Marriage be Conſummated, and then deſpair not but the Princeſs Infanta would beg the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with her earneſt Prayers, that ſhe might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

HIS Majeſty being in the Eſcurial, I deſired theſe, my Lords the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, that they wou'd repair hither, to the end that we might treat of perfecting thoſe things which concern the <hi>Palatine;</hi> foraſmuch as might be done from hence, wherein we procure, as you know, to give Satisfaction to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> through whoſe Interceſſion, together with that of the moſt Excellent Prince his Highneſs, we have procured to diſpoſe things in <hi>Germany,</hi> and have uſed thoſe Diligences which you know. The Means which hath ever ſeemed moſt eaſie, and apt for the well addreſſing of this Buſineſs, is to Marry the Eldeſt Son of the <hi>Palatine</hi> to the ſecond Daughter of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, bringing him up in the Court of his Caeſareal Majeſty, whereby the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, both of the States and Electorate to the ſaid Son might be the better, and more ſatisfactorily diſpoſed. And in this Conformity, we have ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and treated, and propounded it here. But now coming cloſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Buſineſs, as I ſaid before, thoſe my Lords the Embaſſadors ſay, that the thing which on their Part hath been deſired and that which the moſt Excellent Prince, and the Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did carry away in their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that which the Embaſſadors themſelves have written to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> was, That we muſt procure that the Reſtitution of theſe States may be to the <hi>Palatine</hi> himſelf. This Point carrieth ſo great Difficulty with it to be conveyed to the Emperor's Ears, that it may be feared, yea, and held for certain, that the Perſons who are intereſted in this Buſineſs, wou'd procure to over-turn the World, to make Complaints to the Pope, and to have recourſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to others exaggerating that which they have done, for the Reſtitution of that to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which had been taken from it. And they wou'd alſo ponder that which concerneth Religion, whereby they might diſquiet the Mind of Man, and ſay, that they having acquired it by their Arms, or given Aſſiſtance towards it, it is now taken from them, and given to one, who hath been a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel (for this is the Language they will hold) and is ſtill an Enemy of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion. And this being exaggerated (as they well know how to do) it may perhaps breed ſuch Difficulty in the Buſineſs, as that the Reſtitution even of the Son will not be obtain'd; a thing which would be ill for us all, and worſe perhaps for the Palatine himſelf, and his Children.

                           </gap> that which is now deſired concerning the <hi>Palatine</hi> in his Perſon, wherein my Lord the King will uſe all the poſſible Endeavor by doing Offices to the Emperor to obtain it
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49492:79"/>and ſo to ſettle things with ſatisfaction, which the Pope, and other Princes and Potentates may receive by this way, and which cannot be by that other to which my Lords the Ambaſſadors do point. For as long as Men will ſpeak of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Perſon of the Palatine, they have room to reprove his Actions, and to hide their own Intereſts by the pretext of the Juſtifiableneſs of his Puniſhment. And I conceive that although his Majeſty will uſe all poſſible Endeavour, yet the Buſineſs will be as it were impoſſible, if we uſe not the <hi>Medium</hi> of depriving them of their Hopes, by placing all upon the Son. And I reſolved to ſay all this to you, to the end you may repreſent it to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> aſſuring him that here is great deſire to give him Satisfaction in all that is poſſible; and that we muſt help our ſelves to obtein this by not demanding things that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; and whereby (beſides the difficulty which they would have) very great Inconveniencies, and greater Diſquiet might reſult. And I hope that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, according to his great Prudence, will conſider and underſtand it after the ſame manner; and you who underſtand the Buſineſs ſo, will give it ſo to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Yet uſe it with that Prudence, which you think convenient.</p>
                        <p n="162">162. For by theſe means I hold the Emperor to be in a manner already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and by that other, although the thing be attempted, and though we for our parts do all that poſſibly we can, as we will do, and this ſhall be given in Writing to the Ambaſſador, if they preſs it: Yet I fear much, and I have much Ground to do ſo, that we ſhall not be able to obtein it, and that we ſhall ſcandalize and loſe Reputation. And it will prove as ill-favour'd a piece of Work, as that which hapned in the Electorate of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which we contradicted and <hi>France</hi> favoured. And if I may tell you freely what I think, that which is preſſed is much leſs, than that which I offer. Since by that which I ſay, the Reſtitution of all the States is preſently fix'd upon the Grand-Child of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorate after the Life of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> yea, and during that Life, all that may be done without affronting the ſaid Duke. And in that other way which is offer'd, we are to walk all the Days of our Lives in the Queſtion, Whether the Submiſſion which the Palatine maketh be ſufficient or no? And they who have Intereſts herein will be ſure to except after a critical manner to any defect which may be ſuſpected. And as long as the State ſhall be undeliver'd, the Buſineſs certainly will grow to nothing, and become ſubject to the Power, which ſome intereſted Perſons have with the Emperor. All which would ceaſe, if the Submiſſion which the Palatine is to make were to be after the Eſtates, were to be order'd to the eldeſt Son by this Match, ſo that the Palatine would in fine make due Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and give convenient Satisfaction and Security for true Friendſhip and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Emperor, my Lord the King, and the Noble Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> I confeſs that I am a young Miniſter of State, and I ſhew it by deſiring to redreſs Buſineſſes by way of Effecting, and not of Delays, which are ever uſed by old and prudent Miniſters. And I know that without doubt, that the Propoſition, which is made by me, is the better way. And ſo you may underſtand thus much for your ſelf: And according to the diſpatch which you ſhall receive of the Ambaſſador, you may go walking on. The thing which I conceive is the thing I relate unto you here, and that which I told you by Word of Mouth in <hi>Madrid,</hi> although the Ambaſſador, as I ſaid before, affirm, that you, and they, yea and the Prince had miſtaken this, by underſtanding that the delivery of the States ſhould inſtantly be made to the Perſon of the Count Palatine, and not to his Son. And I would to God I might ſee this obteined of the Emperor, who doth ſo greatly deſire the Peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the repoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria.</hi> For I for my part would be ſure to do all that poſſibly I could for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof. Beſides this, I have ſeen by a Reply of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s, that he maketh inſtance for us to ponder the Engagement wherein the moſt Excellent King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> doth find himſelf, by his having obliged himſelf by publick Writings to reſtore all entirely, or elſe to put all that he hath in adventure. It is here to be underſtood, that when it is ſaid that that King made this Writing, yet (in caſe he made it) the Palatine had not then committed thoſe things, which he executed afterward againſt the Will and Counſel of the moſt Excellent King of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Nor can any prudent Man oblige himſelf to all thoſe Errours, which may be committed. And if the Count Palatine had followed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the moſt Excellent King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> many of thoſe things which have ſucceeded had been prevented, and the Grace of the Emperor had been better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed than now it is. Beſide that much hath been ſpent, and that they have ſeen him ſo obſtinate ſtirring up againſt the Emperor both the Turk, and <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:49492:79"/>and as many others as he hath been able. I ſay not this to the end that we ſhould forbear to do whatſoever in this World we ſhould be able to accommodate the Palatine, and to do in this behalf that which the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> doth ſhew that he deſireth. But to ſay that which is certain, his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> doth by no means find himſelf in this Buſineſs any other ways engaged, than he ſhall find that Engagement to be juſtifiable. God keep you as I deſire.</p>

This long, riddling, non-concluding Letter, (ſuch another as <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor wrote from <hi>Capree</hi> to the Senate for the Tryal of <hi>Sejanus</hi>) is not endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I conceive it was ſent to Mr. <hi>Edward Clerke,</hi> who was ſent from the Prince on Shipboard to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to ſtop the Powers he had for the diſpatch of the expected Deſpoſories, this was put into his Hand againſt he return'd for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But what is it worth if it were to be ſold? Scarce two of their Maravedies; and we requited them with that which came to as little as one of our Farthings. We had look'd after the Re-poſſeſſion of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> till our Eyes aked; and to feed them with a taſte of their own Provender, a long-breath'd Delay, we made their Ambaſſadors in <hi>London</hi> tarry for the Indulgences, which their Clients in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hoped for, till their Hearts aked. It is opened ſufficiently before, that his Majeſties End in ſubſcribing to the Articles in favour of the Papiſts his Subjects was, to ſecond his Son in that which he had begun in <hi>Spain,</hi> to bring him out of the Briars from thence. The Ambaſſadors plied the Conceſſion of the Articles very diligently, that their Party might enjoy the ſweetneſs of the Benefit. For <hi>better is the ſight of the Eyes, than the wandring of the Deſire,</hi> Eccleſ. 6.9. It fell out well that the King, never intermitting a Summers Progreſs, was out of the way. So the Management of the Buſineſs fell upon the Lord Keeper, not by Uſurpation, but by Merit, and by Neceſſity too. For, whatſoever his Majeſty pretended, he gave the Keeper a ſecret Rule, to go no faſter than needs, and to do no more prejudice than was unavoidable. A Regiment of Plots would hardly be enough to be drawn up together to win that Enterpriſe; though a good Sconce overcame all.

                     <hi>Mens bona, ſi qua Dea es, tua me in ſacraria dona,</hi> ſays a Heathen. As all coſtly Oyntments have Oyl mixed with them, ſo Wiſdom perſumes all Undertakings, as this under the File will demonſtrate. The Ambaſſador uſed their Counſel Learned in our Laws to draw up the effect, of that they had obtained, as near as could be to his Majeſties Mind. Which was brought to the Lord Keeper; who told them, The Papers were unſatisfactory; they had proceeded indeed by the Articles ſigned in the private Lodgings at <hi>Whitehal;</hi> but the private Articles ſhew only the extent of his Majeſties Grace and Favour in the ſubſtance; not at all the Manner and Form how they ſhall be conveyed; which muſt be chalked out by a new and immediate Warrant from his Majeſty. This held diſpute till the 10th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> his Majeſty being at <hi>Salisbury;</hi> where Directions paſt to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidate the Doubts, how the Kings Grants ſhould be applied, call'd from that place the Articles of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> For which the Agents of the Ambaſſadors were to reſort to the Earl of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and Mr. Secretary <hi>Conway,</hi> attending in the Progreſs, and the Patents to be filled up with them by the Diſcretion of the Lord Keeper, Lord Treaſurer, Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Weſton</hi> Chancellor of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, Mr. Atturney-General, Sir <hi>Th. Coventry</hi> attending, who were to ſit at <hi>Whitehal</hi> for the more eaſie Expedition. Time is given to draw up Copies of new Draughts. <hi>Interea aliquid fiet ſpero,</hi> ſays the Comick. In theſe Intervals who could tell, but ſomewhat might fall out to croſs all? On the 18th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Lord Keeper ſends the Form of the Pardon drawn up to the King at <hi>Beawlie,</hi> to ſave the Recuſants from all Advantages the Laws might take for the time paſt; and a Diſpenſation to keep them indemnified from the ſame for the time to come. But an <hi>Item</hi> was given, to bring the Diſpenſation lame back, that his Majeſty ſhould ſignifie his Royal Will, That the Pardon ſhould go under the Great Seal, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation under the Privy Seal: This from <hi>Beawlie, Aug.</hi> 21. And there was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for it out of the Agreements of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſubtilly drawn up. For the ſecond
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49492:80"/>Article ſays, That <hi>a Legal Authentical Pardon ſhall be paſt under the Great Seal:</hi> And in the ſeventh Article, <hi>There ſhall be a preſent Suſpenſion of his Majeſties Laws under his Seal.</hi> The word <hi>Great</hi> was wilfully omitted to puzzle the Tranſaction. But after the Spaniſh part had debated with the Lord Keeper in Reaſon, he writes to Secretary <hi>Conway</hi> at <hi>Tichburn, Aug.</hi> 25. That <hi>he confeſt a Diſpenſation from the Poenal Statutes could not be pleaded, but under the Great Seal.</hi> The Buſineſs got off in that Point, but it hung upon another Tentar. He writes again to Mr. Secretary then at <hi>Broad-lands, Aug.</hi> 27. That <hi>it troubled him much he was enforced to ſuch often Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, but the Weight of the Buſineſs would excuſe it.</hi> He ſays, <hi>He was not inſtructed from the Articles of</hi> Salisbury, <hi>from what Day the Diſpenſation was to begin, and how far it was to be limited in time to come; from what time thoſe are to be excluded that do not lay hold of it.</hi> To which anſwer was given; but always the Dial ſtood. Once again he demurr'd upon the Diſpenſation, which ſays, <hi>That the Papiſts Convict ſhall not pay their Forfeiture for not coming to Church, nor be Indicted for not taking the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance; whether it was not fit to divide theſe in ſeveral Styles and Expreſſions.</hi> It was return'd, and dictated from the Kings Lips; <hi>The firſt Breach of the Laws ſhould be ſignified to be abſolutely pardoned; The latter ſhould go in another Form, that it ſhould not be queſtioned, and Mr. Atturney to provide accordingly for Legal Notions.</hi> When the Lord Keeper had done with the Living, he began with the Dead; and ſcrupled how their Dead ſhould be Interr'd, ſo as to give no offence, nor be obnoxious to be offended. The Reſolution was brought to him that ſent it, That <hi>their Burials ſhould be in their private Houſes, as ſecret as might be, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſign of Manifeſtation; but Notice to be given to the Pariſh-Clerk of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</hi>

The Reader may take in ſo ſmall a matter by the way, that the Writer of theſe Paſſages ſaid to the Lord Keeper, That <hi>the Marquiſs was the moſt ſurly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing Man that ever came to his Houſe.</hi> His Lordſhip anſwer'd, <hi>They were his Manners by Nature:</hi> But he had been ſo vain to profeſs, That <hi>he came an Enemy to us into</hi> England; <hi>and for this Dowty Cauſe:</hi> His Father was a Page to King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, while he lived here with Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and was diſcourteouſly uſed in our Court, perhaps by the Pages. Which was a Quarrel of Seventy Years old, and bearing date before the Marquiſs was born. Which will cauſe a Paſſage of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Sicily</hi> to be remembred, who had robb'd and ſpoil'd ſome of the Iſlands under the Protection of <hi>Athens;</hi> and when the Injury was expoſtulated, he told them, <hi>Their Countryman</hi> Ulyſſes <hi>had uſed the</hi> Sicilians <hi>worſe</hi> 700 <hi>Years before, as he believ'd it to be very true in</hi> Homer. This Ambaſſador was a reſtleſs Man, and held the Lord Keeper ſo cloſe to turn and plow up the fallow of this Buſineſs, that he would not give him the Jubilee of a Day to reſt. Yet the time, do what he could, had run at waſte from the 20th of <hi>July,</hi> to the end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Then, and no ſooner, the Frames of the Pardon and Diſpenſation were contriv'd and diſpatch'd. Yet the Mill would not go with this Water. The Ambaſſadors call'd for more: That two general Commands ſhould be iſſued forth under the Great Seal, the firſt to all the Judges and Juſtices of Peace; the other to all Biſhops, Chancellors, and Commiſſaries not to execute any Statute made againſt the Papiſts. Hereupon the Spaniſh Faction was ſuſpected, that they had no hopes to bring ſome ſecret Drifts to paſs, but by raiſing a general hatred againſt our Government. The Lord Keeper repulſed the Motion, and wrote to the King being at <hi>Alderſhot,</hi> That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Inſtance the Ambaſſador makes to the contrary, there was no reaſon why his Majeſties Wiſdom ſhould give place to them. He propounded, That a private Warrant might be directed to himſelf, to will him to write to the reſpective Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates fore-nam'd, to acquaint them with the Graces which his Majeſty had paſt for Recuſants in that Exigence, and to ſuſpend their Proceeding till they heard further. For as the Civilians ſay, <hi>Ceſſant extraordinaria, ubi ordinariis eſt locus.</hi> Thus he contriv'd it, that the King, as much as might be, ſhould eſcape the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and let the Rumour light upon his private Letters. For which he never put the King to ſtand between the People, and his Errour; nor beſought him to excuſe it to the next Parliament: But as <hi>Mamertinus</hi> in <hi>Paneg.</hi> ſaid of his own Conſulſhip, <hi>Non modò nullum popularium deprecatus ſum, ſed ne te quidem Imperator, quem orare praeclarum, cui preces adhibere pleniſſimum dignitatis eſt.</hi> Yet leſt the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador ſhould complain of him to the Prince in <hi>Spain,</hi> he writes to the Duke, <hi>Cab.

                     <hi>THat he had prevailed with the Lords to ſtop that vaſt, and general Prohibition, and gave in three Days Conference ſuch Reaſons to the two Ambaſſadors, (although it is no eaſie matter to ſatisfie the Capriciouſneſs of the latter of them) that they were both content it ſhould reſt, till the</hi> Infanta <hi>had been ſix Months in</hi> England. <hi>For to forbid Judges againſt their Oath, and Juſtices of Peace (ſworn likewiſe) not to execute the Law of the Land, is a thing unprecedented in this Kingdom.</hi> Durus ſermo, <hi>a harſh and bitter Pill to be digeſted upon a ſuddain, and without ſome Preparation. But to grant a Pardon even for a thing that is</hi> malum in ſe; <hi>and a Diſpenſation with Poenal Statutes, (in the profit whereof the King only is intereſted) is uſual, full of Precedents, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

That whereas his Majeſty being at this time to Mediate for Favour to many Proteſtants in Foreign Parts, with the Princes of another Religion, and to ſweeten the Entertainment of the Princeſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Kingdom, who is yet a Roman Catholick, doth hold the Mitigation of the Rigour of thoſe Laws made againſt Recuſants, to be a neceſſary Inducement to both thoſe Purpoſes, and hath therefore iſſued forth ſome Pardons of Grace and Favour to ſuch Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, of whoſe Fidelity to the State he reſts aſſur'd. That therefore you the Lord Biſhops, Judges and Juſtices, (each of thoſe to be written to by themſelves) do take Notice of his Majeſties Pardon, and Diſpenſation, with all ſuch Poenal Laws, and demean your ſelves accordingly.</hi>

All his Art would be requir'd to reconcile two things: That the Ambaſſador ſhould be put off no longer, (for ſo the King had now commanded by Diſpatches from both the Secretaries;) And that he would finiſh nothing, till he had heard either his Highneſs, or the Duke's Opinion upon the Proceeding. The general Pardon, and the Diſpenſation were both ſealed: So he began. But kept them by him, and would not open the leaſt Window to let either Dove or Raven fly abroad. The King being return'd to <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſignification was given, that none of the Lords ſhould come to him, till he ſent for them, and was ready for Matters of moment. No Superſtructure could go on very faſt, when that Stone was laid. From <hi>Windſor, Sept.</hi> 5. Sir <hi>G. Calvert</hi> writes to him, <hi>My very good Lord, His Majeſty being reſolv'd to extend his Gracious Favour to the Roman Catholicks, ſignifies his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, That your Lordſhip ſhould direct your Letter to the Biſhops, Judges,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to forbear any Moleſlation of his ſaid Subjects in reſpect of their Religion. To ſend them forth with as much ſpeed, as conveniently may be, that his Majeſty may be freed from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Ambaſſadors.</hi> Thrice again he was charg'd with the ſame Command. To all which he anſwer'd, <hi>He could do nothing without a private Warrant for it, and that it was not poſſible to be agreed upon, till he ſpake with his Majesty.</hi> On the 6th of <hi>September,</hi> the ſame Secretary writes again, That <hi>an Exemplification of the Pardon ſhould be deliver'd to the Ambaſſadors under the Great Seal.</hi> That's not hard to be done: <hi>But upon what Limits and Conditions?</hi> So the Lord Keeper rejoyns. Sir <hi>G. Calvert</hi> is troubled again to ſatisfie that Scruple, That no Copy of it ſhould go out to any of the Roman Catholicks, nor any of them be permitted to ſue out their Pardons, until his Majeſties Pleaſure be further known. This came <hi>Sept.</hi> 8. The Lord Keeper held back yet, till he knew what Aſſurance he ſhould have from the Ambaſſadors to keep thoſe Conditions: Which held a Conteſt till <hi>Sept.</hi> 19. When Mr. Secretary <hi>Conway</hi> writes from <hi>Theobalds, His Majesties Pleaſure is, That you deliver unto the Marquiſs</hi> Inoioſa <hi>an Exemplification of the Pardon, and Diſpenſation. And his Majeſty would not that you ſhould preſs him for a Note of his Hand for Secreſie and Stanchneſs, for giving of Copies of the Pardon, or Diſpenſation, but only by Word to refreſh his Memory of the faithful Promiſes he hath made in that Point to the King, upon which his Majesty will relie.</hi> Indeed it was order'd at <hi>Windſor, Sept.</hi> 7. as appears in a Letter of Secretary <hi>Conways,</hi> that when Marquiſs <hi>Inioſa</hi> had the Exemplication, (all the Craſt was in Catching) that he ſhould communicate them to none, nor
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49492:81"/>give Copies of them, till we had knowledge from <hi>Spain</hi> of the Marriage, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſories. There was nothing about theſe days that mitigated the Embaſſador more, than a Trick, that, in ſine, did him leaſt good. Properly, and without Levity, it may be called a Flop with a Fox-Tail. The Lord Keeper cloſed in with him not to be ſo haſty for Exemplifications, which the Clerks of the Crown muſt write over ſoft and fairly. A Matter of more weight ſhould preſently be ſet on foot, not of Words, but of real Benefit and Performance to his Party, and to the Choice of them, a Pardon for the Romiſh Prieſts that were impriſoned; about which there had been ſtruggling, and yet nothing effected. As the Lord Keeper ſeemed forward, ſo (to ſee the ill Luck) it was cramp'd by a Letter from Sir <hi>Edward Conway, Sept.</hi> 6. Dat. <hi>Windſor.</hi>

The People began to be churliſh that he ſtaid ſo long: And his Majeſty look'd for no Good from that Part of the World, while our Duke was in it. He found, that ſo long as he was ſo remote from his Tutorſhip, he was heady, a Novice in carrying Buſineſs, and very offenſive to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Prince was deſirous to make haſte from them, that would make no better haſte; and could no longer endure the Pace of a dull Spaniſh Mule. As a weary Traveiler's Inn ſeems ſtill to go further from him, ſo his Highneſs had attended long for a ſweet Repoſe in Wedlock, till it made him impatient, and think that every Conſuito caſt him further back from the Fruition of his Joys. The Junto of the Spaniſh Stateſ-men were very magiſterial, and would not bate an Inch, but that every thing ſhould be timed to a day, as they deſigned it. Theſe were the Links of the Chain, by which they pluck all Power to themſelves. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Diſpoſorios, or Contract muſt go before the Marriage: For that's a Rule from which their Church doth never vary, unleſs good Order be broken by clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriages.

Then the Prince may take his own Time to return when he will,; but the Lady could not make ready for the Seas, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Train that muſt attend her, till</hi> March. The Prince did not like the Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick of this Counting-Table. More time than the firſt Week of <hi>September</hi> he was reſolved not to ſpend in that Land. The Coming of the Diſpenſation he would not await, which might be failing thither upon the idle Lake in the Fary Queen: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He muſt take a Bleſſing from one of their Biſhops in the Face of their Church, and ſubmit to their Trinckets and Ceremonies, which he had rather hear than ſee. Then if the Infanta had Conceived, they would keep her, it is likely, till ſhe was delivered: The Child muſt ſtay till it was ſtrong to endure the Seas, ſo it might come to paſs to be bred up and Naturalized a Spaniard in Religion and Affection. When the Clock would not go right with thoſe Plummets, the Junto caſt the ime out ino another Figure, that his Highneſs would, out of Courtſhip, wherein he excelled, and out of great Love to his Miſtreſs, which he profeſſed, perfect the Deſponſation in his own Perſon, and truſt no other with it; the Marriage and the Lady ſhould follow after, that is, upon the Certificate of their Embaſſador out of <hi>England,</hi> that Conditions were performed there, to which the King of <hi>Great Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At laſt his Highneſs took upon him to deſide the Wrangling, and caſt out the ſacred Anchor
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49492:82"/>from the Stern, to keep their Counſels from further Floating, that he would be burdenſom to the K. of <hi>Spain</hi> no longer; the magnetick Vertue of his own Country drew him to it. Yet to confirm that he leſt his Heart behind with his Beauteous and high born Miſtreſs, he would Sign a Proxy, and Aſſign it to K. <hi>Philip,</hi> or his Brother <hi>Don Carlo,</hi> or either of them, which ſhould remain in the Cuſtody of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that the Eſpouſals between him and the Infanta might be ratified, within ten days after the diſpenſation unſtopt the way unto them; and he would leave it to the <hi>Princeſſa</hi> to ſhew her Cordial and Amorcuolous Affections how ſoon ſhe would prepare to follow after him.</p>

When it came to the King her Brothers turn to Act his part of Royal Civility, he carried the Prince with him to his moſt gorgeous and ſpacious Structure of the Eſcurial.

They doubted that <hi>Buckingham</hi> would do all he could to croſs the Match, ſays <hi>Briſtol</hi> in the ſame Letter; yet they were ſo Stately, that they would not ſeek to a ſuſpected Enemy.

                     </gap>; to Repoſe the hopes of well doing upon their own Strength and Judgment, not upon the Adverſaries Weakneſs. The Duke <hi>Olivares</hi> was never the nearer, that <hi>Buckingham</hi> told him at their farewel, <q>That for his part, he had ſo diſoblig'd him, that he would make no profeſſion of Friendſhip to him at all; but he would be an everlaſting Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Queen, and the Infanta, and would do the beſt Offices he could, for the concluding the buſineſs, and ſtrengthning Amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kingdoms.</q> 
                     <hi>Olivares</hi> was not certain of him upon theſe Words, ſince he was not certain at that time what himſelf would have. For when our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are out of Order, it is a hard thing for a Man to ſpeak Truth to himſelf. As ſoon as the Duke had the Prince at ſhrift, as it were, in his Cabinet, Mr. <hi>Edward Clerk</hi> under Colour to Attend the Spaniſh Nobles to <hi>Madrid,</hi> was ſent with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> to ſuſpend the Procuration for the Contract, till further Order was given. One Scruple which muſt firſt be cleared was, <q>That a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery might not Rob the Prince of his Wife. For a Headleſs Fable (unleſs <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livares</hi> his Salt Tongue had given occaſion to it) was in many Mouths, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Deſponſories, the Lady would enter into the ſtrict Order of the <hi>Deſcalcas,</hi> or bare Foot Nuns.</q> A Rumour that was Laugh'd out of countenance; for ſhe was a ſpriteful Virgin, and had nothing of Monaſtical Auſterity in her Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither did ſhe diſſemble, but carried her Affections undiſguiſed, that ſhe was ſtricken in Love with the Prince. Yet, to prevent the worſt, the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> was ſerious in Refuting that Folly, as it is extant in his to the Prince, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 24. <q>I have ſet down to your Highneſs all ſorts of ſecurity, that may be taken before the betrothing, for preventing a Woman <hi>Poſt vatum Matrimonium, non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatum,</hi> to betake her ſelf into a Religious Life.</q> The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta, all the Miniſters, would refuſe no kind of ſecurity that in Reaſon could be demanded in that behalf. This was a ſlight pretence, and ſoon over. There was another thing of greater Conſequence Weaved into the miſtruſt I find it upon the Point wherein the Duke Expoſtulated with Sir <hi>W. Aſton Cab. p.</hi> 35. You might have obſerved the Explanation the Prince made of himſelf to you by his Letters from St. <hi>Andreas,</hi> and have ſeen his Care and Reſolution, not to engage himſelf into the Marriage, without good Conditions for the Palatinate, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Honour every way.

It is common with the Great ones that Rule the Earth, to Treat together to make ſuch Links with their Children, Nay, with their Infants. They confirm them with Embaſſies, with Articles, it may be with their Oaths, and Holy Ceremonies. Yet when all this is done, if a greater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſit to the State ſpring up by a New Offer, a Curtain is drawn before Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: The former Intereſt muſt give place to the later; and that ſhall be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the like occaſion for a freſh Emolument. One Reaſon, I believe, tho' I write it fearfully, <q>That often times they are but little bleſt in their Progenies. For can the moſt High forget it, <hi>Cui vincla jugalia curae.</hi> Virg.</q> They that uncover Stories of Realms and Common Wealths, let them apply it. I go on to mine. At the Eſcurial of St. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> this was the laſt Speech and accord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Palatinate. The Prince making earneſt obteſtation for it, K. <hi>Philip</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Honour of a King upon it, <q>That he would intermit neither fair means, nor ſoul means with the Emperor, that it might be reſigned into his Hand, and then ſhould be beſtowed as a Gift upon the Marriage.</q> Hereupon his Highneſs ſeemed to depart well ſatisfied. Yet, having removed no further then from St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> to St. <hi>Andreas,</hi> Expoſtulates to have the Palatinate ſurendred to the Right owner, and the Eſpouſals to be procraſtinated till it was done; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> tells our Meſſenger, <q>He would do all he had promiſed upon the laſt Agreement, and for his Life he could do no more.</q> So the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> remembers it to the Prince, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 25. <q>They go on chearfully and confidently, and I conceive, will punctually perform all that they have Capitulated with you.</q> The Prince knew well where he was now; when all their Capitulations were held to be Star-ſhootings, Flaſhes, and Meteors, without the Bird in the Hand. <hi>Plato</hi> hath a Crotchet <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>de leg.</hi> to ſhew the Citizens of his imagin'd Common-Wealth, what they ſhould do to eſcape all, or the moſt Suits in Law, that trouble men with Charge and Delays; <hi>Marry,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Truſt no Man without ready Mony in Buying, and Bargaining, wherein, if you fail, you ſhall have no Action to recover your Debt.</hi> This Platonick dealing, with which the Spaniards Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd us, was a New Erection of Juſtice, by which, the Marriage was conſum'd into no Marriage, but into a Platonick Love. Whether the Prince were at Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having ſaid and done ſo much at the Eſcurial, to break off upon his own Conditions, is ſuch a Knot, as I cannot find the Ends of it. Therefore whether we came off clear, or were ſullied with ſome Diſhonour, is too intricate to be decided. In a Report made to the Parliament hereafter, the Lord Keeper, being called unto it, ſtretch'd his Learning to prove, That any Man might lawfully Revoke his Procuration; but he came not up to the Top of the Queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Juſtifiable to Revoke the Obligation of Faith and Honour. <hi>Aliud eſt jura ſpectare, aliud juſtitiam.</hi> Cicer. pro Balbo.

This is ſtrange to thoſe that knew not his Highneſs, who had a Quality to his Lives End (I will call it Humility, it is ſomewhat like it, but it is not it) to be eaſily perſwaded out of his own Knowledg and Judgment, by ſome whom he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have Power upon him, who had not the half of his intellectuals.

Not an Inch of the Palatinate the better for us; and we the worſe for our Wars in all Countries. I ſay no more, but as <hi>Q.

The French are as brave a people as be under the Sun: Yet, for my part I think we might better want them, then the Spaniard. The Spaniſh Ladies Married to the Royal Seed among us, have been Vertuous, Mild, Thrifty, beloved of all.

Thirdly, In Retaliation for the Priſoners that were ſet at Liberty in <hi>Spain</hi> to Congratulate the Princes welcom.

The Duke prepared the King ſo well, as His Majeſty gave me order to ſignifie to you, that thoſe Letters ſhould ſtill be retained, unleſs ſome Complaints ſhould make change of Counſels; or the Accompliſhment on the other ſide equal that of ours, and occaſion another ſtep forward.

And I know your Lordſhip will give me leave to make you as glad as my ſelf, that abſence hath made no change towards my Lord Duke in the Kings Favour; but his return, if it be poſſible, hath multiplied it. And the Prince and He are for Communications of Counſels, Deliberations, and Reſolutions, as if they were but One.</p>

                  <p>Neither did the Spaniards return the Jewels which the Prince had preſented at the Shrine of Love, till the end of <hi>February;</hi> at which Surrendry, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the golden Cord was broken. Nothing is more ſure, than that the Prince's Heart was removed from the Deſire of that Marriage, after the Duke had brought him away from the Object of that Delightful and Raviſhing Beauty. But all the while the King had his Head full of Thoughts, brooding upon two things (like the Twins that ſtruggled in the Womb of <hi>Rebeckah</hi>) the Conſummation of the Marriage, and the Patrimony of his Son-in-Law to be regained, with the Dignity Electoral. His Wiſdom hovered between them both, like the Sun at his Noonday Height. <hi>Metâ diſtans aequalis utraque:</hi> He knew he ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, to the wounding of all Good Opinion, if he did not engraſt that Alliance into his Stem, which he had ſought with ſo much Expence of Time and Coſt, to ſtrengthen and aggrandize his Poſterity. And he knew he ſhould looſe Honour with all the Potentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> beſide other Miſchiefs, if nothing were done for re-poſſeſſing the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> Yet in ſine, he ſate down, and it cleaſt his Heart, that he affected neither. As a Canker eats quickly into ſoft and ſappy Wood, ſo an Error was gotten into his gentle Nature, the ſame that <hi>Spartianus</hi> ſays had crept into <hi>Didius Julianus: Reprehenſus in eo praecipue, quos regere authoritate ſud debuit, regendae reipub. praeſules ſibi ipſe fecit.</hi> He ſubmitted himſelf to be ruled by ſome, whom he ſhould have awed with Authority; but he wanted Courage to bow them to his own Bent. A Prince that preſerves not the Rights of his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Majeſty of his Throne, is a Servant to ſome, but therein a Friend to none, leaſt of all to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="174">174. But he did ſo little bear up with an Imperatorian Reſolution, againſt the Method of their Ways, who thruſt his Counſels out of Doors, that the Flies ſuck'd him where he was gall'd, and he never rub'd them off. He continued at <hi>Newmarket</hi> as in an Infirmary, for he forgot his Recreations of Hunting and Hawking; yet could not be drawn to keep the Feaſts of <hi>All-Saints,</hi> and the Fifth of <hi>November</hi> at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> being wont to ſhew his Preſence at thoſe Solemnities. Againſt <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> he drew towards the City, and no ſooner. Some better Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were expected from <hi>Spain</hi> by that time, or more certain Diſcoveries be found out of Carriage on both ſides, for hitherto all was received upon ſecond hand Faith Therefore his Majeſty was no ſooner at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> but he commiſſioned a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Council to conſider two things: Whither the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had not been real to the laſt, to ſatisfie the Deſire of the Prince about the Marriage; and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Treaty for the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he had violated the League between the two Kingdoms, as to deſerve an open War to be proclaimed againſt him. The Lord Keeper was one of the Junto; but ſo far againſt his Mind, that he wiſhed before a Friend or two in private, that a Fever in his Sick Bed might excuſe him. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was mortally Anti-Spaniſh, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was headed with Steel. He aſſayed the Lord Keeper to hale him to his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as an Eddy doth a ſmall Boat; and would have uſed him to the King, to incline his Majeſty to renounce Amity with that Nation; but he found him as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible as a dried Bough. He vowed to his Grace, as he ſhould have God to be his Protector, that he would ſuffer all the Obliquy of the World, before he would be drawn to the leaſt Ingratitude againſt his Lordſhip, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 89. But when the King asked his Judgment, he muſt be true and faithful. Which was to ſay, to do
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49492:86"/>the Duke a Pleaſure, he cared not to deſerve ill of himſelf, but he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ill of the King: which gave no Satisfaction. Oh! How better is a poor Man's Liberty, than the golden Servitude of a great Officer? Muſt I loſe my Patron, unleſs I loſe my Judgment? Can there not be a true Heart, where there is not Sameneſs of Opinion? What a Structure is Advancement, which hangs in the Air, and conſiſts upon no ſolid Foundation? That great Lord deſied the Keeper to his Face, and in the hearing of many, threatned to ſink him, becauſe he could not board him. And as <hi>Fulbertus</hi> ſaid of Queen <hi>Conſtantia, Cui ſatis cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, dum mala promittit; Baron. Annal.</hi> 12 28. <hi>com.</hi> 12. If he promiſed an ill turn, he would be ſure to pay it, if he could. Once upon a time he could have done as much as that came to, with half a Word to the King. Now, as his Lordſhip conceived, his Strength lay among the Anakims, and the ſelf-will'd man plotted to ſacrifice his old Friend to the Parliament (the Intelligence came from the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Embaſſador) to appeaſe the Diſlike of Immunities (which were none at all) exerciſed towards the Roman Catholicks. Yet there his Lordſhip faired, and found it as hard to ſuppreſs him, as to drown a Swan. There is an Electuary which Phyſicians give to comfort the Heart, called <hi>Paſta rogia;</hi> the Lord Keeper was fed Luſty with this Royal Paſte. The King had wrought him ſo apt to his own Plight, that the Power of a mighty Favorite could not wreſt him from the Sanctuary of his Love. Ye ſtill his Danger was, that the Duke thought (out of Diſdain more than Envy) that he wore too many Copies of his Majeſty's Favour. He took nothing more Scornſully, than what the King ſpake to the Earl of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle</hi> in a Fit of Melancholly, That if he had ſent <hi>Williams</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> with his Son, he had kept Hearts-eaſe and Honour, both which he lack'd at that time. So it was thought to be next to an Affront, that the firſt time the Lord Keeper came into the King's Preſence, after his Highneſs's Return into <hi>England</hi> (which was a little before <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>) his Majeſty looking intently upon him, ſaid thus to the Prince: Charles, <hi>There's the Man that makes us keep a merry</hi> Chriſtmas. His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs looking as if he underſtood not his Father; <hi>Why, 'tis he,</hi> ſays the King, <hi>that laboured more dextrouſly than all my Servants beſide, to bring you ſafe hither to keep</hi> Chriſtmas <hi>with me, and I hope you are ſenſible of it.</hi> Another Act of the King's Goodneſs drew a greater Frown upon him: That in thoſe Holy-days, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, of his own Accord, no Solicitation preceding, cauſed an Act of Council to be entred into the Book of that Honorable Table, that an Arch-Biſhoprick, and he named <hi>York,</hi> ſhould be conſerred upon him in the next Vacancy. For which, the Lord Keeper moſt humbly thanked his Majeſty, that he was pleaſed to think of him, when his Majeſty knew beſt, that he thought not of himſelf. Yet my Lord Duke reſented it ill, as if he climbed without his Hand to lift him up. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Mathew</hi> underſtanding how his Place was deſigned, took occaſion to be pleaſant upon it. It was a Felicity which Nature had given him, to make old Age comfortable with a light Heart.

But in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Council, which met to reſolve the two foregoing Queſtions, he was active as any man. If he come not off well in that, let him be condemned. To the firſt matter in propoſal the Lords agreed, that the Prince came Home with great and happy Renown, becauſe he had reſiſted ſo many, and ſo ſtrong Temptations
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49492:86"/>to pervert him in Religion, and that the Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Aſſiſtance was praiſe worthy in exceſs, who held him ſteady, and counter-work'd all Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners. They conceived that the Proceeding of the Spaniards to the moſt were generous; in ſome things rather ſubtle than ingenuous; as there is no Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate but hath ſome rotten Kernels, and that in all they were ſo tedious, that it was able to provoke the Meekneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he had not a Drachm of Choler in his Complexion. Yet that it could not appear, but that the Marriage on King <hi>Philip</hi>'s part was very ſincerely meant in all the Treaty; moſt clearly when his Highneſs took his Farewell, moſt openly ſince his Departure. Wherein the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi> had much wronged that great Monarch, giving him a Baſtle inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. For when the Power of Revocation, or rather Repreſſion of the Proxy, was peremptorily in his Lordſhip's hand, he did not acquaint the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſtop him from erecting a Gallery (turned by the Earl's Negligence into a Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery) in the open Streets, covered with the richeſt Tapeſtry, and ſet forth with all other Circumſtances of Wealth and State, to conduct the Infanta in open View, and with moſt magnificent Solemnity, to the Depoſorios; when by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Commiſſions the Earl had lately received, he knew theſe auguſtious Preparations would be ridiculouſly diſappointed; which was a Deſpight that a Gentleman, not to ſay an Embaſſador, ſhould have prevented. For the Diſgrace was ſo far blown abroad with Deriſion, that it was the News of <hi>Gazette</hi>'s over all <hi>Europe.</hi> The Intention of that Nation to give the Infanta in Marriage to the Prince being not controverted: Yet his Highneſs proteſting on his part that he was free, unleſs the <hi>Palatinate</hi> were ſurrendred, they were all ſatisfy'd with it, his Word was Juſtice to them, and that which was in his own Breaſt, muſt alone direct him how to uſe his Freedom. This Queſtion diſpatched, was upon a blown Roſe, the next was upon a Bramble. The Lord Duke was ſo zealous (ſay it was for the Palſgrave's Sake) that he voted the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be deſied with open War, till amends were made to the illuſtrious Prince Elector, for the Wrongs he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

Their Judgment was, the Girts of Peace were ſlack, but not broken. This is couched in the Admonitions of an Ignote unto King <hi>James, Cab. p.</hi> 278. The Conference or Treaty about the <hi>Palatinate</hi> was taken from the Council of State, a Society of moſt prudent Men, only for this Cauſe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every one of them, had with one Conſent approved the Propoſitions of the moſt Catholick King, and did not find in it any Cauſe of diſſolving the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—And a little beneath, The Duke fled from the Council of State, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it for a Parliament, by way of an Appeal. Moſt true, that ſcarce any in all the Conſulto did vote to my Lord Duke's Satisſaction; which made him riſe up, and chaſe againſt them from Room to Room, as a Hen that hath loſt her Brood, and clucks up and down, when ſhe hath none to follow her. The next time he ſaw the Lord <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> he asked him, with Diſdain, <hi>Are you turned too?</hi> and ſo flung from him, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 243. To which the Lord <hi>Belfaſt</hi> anſwered ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, in a ſhort Letter, <hi>That he would conform himſelf in all things to the Will and good Pleaſure of the King his Maſter.</hi> The greateſt Grudge was againſt the Lord Keeper, who ſeldom ſpake, but all Opinions ran into his one, as they did at this time; and the Duke preſumed that his Sentence ſhould never vary from his own Mind. An hard Injunction, and all the Favour on Earth is too dear to be bought at ſuch a Price. But he declared, that he ſaw no Expediency for War upon the Grounds communicated. <q>For upon whom ſhould we fall? <hi>ſays he,</hi> either upon the Emperor, or the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Emperor had in a fort offered our King his Son-in-Law's Country again for a great Sum, in Recompence of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſments; but where was the Money to be had? Yet it might be cheaper bought than conquered, before a War were ended. For the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſaw no Cauſe to aſſault him with Arms: He had held us indeed in a long Treaty to our Loſs; but he held nothing from us; and was more likely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the State of things in a poſſibility of Accommodation, becauſe he diſliked the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Ambition, and had rather ſtop the Enlargement of his Territories.</q> The King was glad that ſome maintained his Judgment, and would not conſent wantonly to raiſe him from the Down Bed of his long admired Peace. Neither did he refrain to ſpeak very hardly of that Servant whom he loved beſt,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49492:87"/>that agitated to compel him to draw the Sword, one of the great Plagues of God. His Cenſure upon him was bitter, <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 92. but fit to be caſt over-board in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

Such a one doth foreſee how long, how far, how dangerouſly the Fire of War will burn, before he put a Torch to kindle it. And as every Biſhop ought to have a care of the Univerſal Church; ſo every King ought to have a care of all Humane Society. It is not ſuch a thing to raiſe War in theſe Days, as it was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s; Muſter his Servants in one Day, and reſcue <hi>Lot</hi> from his Enemies the next.

I would theſe Notions might be read conſiderately, when any raſh Spirit ſhall attempt to open <hi>Janus</hi>'s Temple, after it hath been long ſhut Yet wo be to the Vicar that ſhould have read this Homily to my Lord Duke. The Lord Keeper's Name was in his black Book of Remembrance for it, till his Lordſhip did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſs him, but blot him out. Revenge is the effect of ſmother'd Anger, as Flame is but lighted Smoak. The Scene wherein an Argument of a kind of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy is couch'd upon it, is in the Lord Duke's Secretaries Letter, <hi>Cab. Pag.</hi> 86. challenging the Lord Keeper, That at the ſelect Council he had run a courſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to his Lordſhip, and (by conſequent to ſill up the Crime) dangerous to the Kingdom, prejudicious to the cauſe of Religion. That the two laſt times they met in Council, the Duke found that he took his Kue (from the Kings Mind) juſt as other Men did, and joyn'd with them in their Opinions, whoſe aim was to tax his Proceedings in the managing of the Prince's Buſineſs. How imperious is this? And how all that follows it like the roaring of a Lyon? And for no more offence, but becauſe he would not condemn the King of <hi>Spain</hi> out of the proof of his Grace's Mouth, and ammerce him with an implacable War, wherein an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Lives might be ſpilt, for a Quarrel begun between himſelf and <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez,</hi> which was not worth a bloody Noſe. Certainly the Lord Keeper could not be afraid of the Duke being ſo much alienated, for any hurt that could come of it at the preſent. I was not in his Heart to eſpy, whether he look'd forward upon another Age in the next Reign. One thing I am conſcious of, that he courted
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49492:87"/>no Man but him with ſupple Submiſſion, being unwilling to nothing more, than that the World ſhould obſerve him diſſever'd from his Promoter, though he were innocent as to making a breach, or the leaſt thought of Oppoſition. The beſt part he could act, was to proteſt how much, and how unſeignedly he was that Lords in a moſt Pathetical Vow, as it is to be found <hi>Cab. P.</hi> 89. <hi>Let this Paper bear Record againſt me at the great Parliament of all, if I be not in my Heart and Soul your Graces moſt faithful and moſt conſtant poor Friend and Servant.</hi> Somewhat alſo may be pick'd out of that Letter by a ſharp Cenſure, as if he had ſought the Duke with Phraſes too low, and too Petitionary. And I am my ſelf within a little of that Opinion. But this was ever a venial Fault at Court; where it was uſual for Men in Place to drink down ſuch hot Affronts, as would ſcald their Throats, that could not endure the Vaſſallage which was tied to Ambition. The beſt Apology is, That a Thankful Man looks for leave, (chuſe you whether you will grant it, for he will take it) to lay himſelf under the Feet of his Benefactor, to be reconciled to him. I learn it from <hi>Tully,</hi> pleading for himſelf againſt <hi>Lateranenſis, Orat, pro Plancio. Nimis magnum beneficium Plancii exaggero. Quare verò me tuo arbitratu, &amp; non meo, gratum eſſe oportet. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teranenſis</hi> ſays, <hi>I do too much extol the Favours which I have received from</hi> Plancius. As if it were not Reaſon that I ſhould be Grateful by my own Acknowledgment, and not by his Opinion. In ſhort, that the Duke might be the better aſlur'd of the reading of ſo able a Miniſter in the Parliament at Hand, the Prince, with his never-failing Sweetneſs, made up this Gap between them; but with a looſe Pale. Yet leave ſhould have been given, where leave was look'd for. The Lord Keeper did not give the Duke content in this ſelect Junto; no more did the Duke give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the King. In the ſame Meaſure that he did mete, it was meaſured unto him.</p>
                  <p n="178">178. Look back about a Twelve-month, and a ſtory will drop in, where the Duke did hearken to the Party with more content. That which was acted a Year ago is in ſeaſon to be produced now, becauſe it was publiſh'd upon Conſideration againſt the Parliament that ſate now. Thoſe dangerous and buſie Flies, which the Roman Seminaries ſend abroad, had buzzed about the Counteſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> had blown upon, and infected her. She was Mother to the great Favourite; but in Religion become a Stepmother. She doated upon him extreamly, as the Glory of her Womb: Yet by turning her Coat ſo wantonly, when the Eyes of all the Kingdom were upon her Family, ſhe could not have wrought him a worſe turn, if ſhe had ſtudied a miſchief againſt him. Many marvelled what rumbled in her Conſcience at that time: For from a Maid to an Old Madam ſhe had not every ones good Word for practice of Piety. And ſhe ſuffered Cenſure to the laſt, that ſhe leſt the Company of Sir <hi>Tho. Compton</hi> her Husband. It hath been ſo with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. But why ſhould a Libertine, that cares not to live after the way of the Goſpel, pretend to ſeek Satisfaction more than ordinary about the true Doctrine of The Goſpel? They that have Beams in their own Eyes, unſanctified Manners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the moſt, why ſhould they cavil at Moats in the Eye of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Let them anſwer it to Him alone, who hath Power to judge them. But divers that had ſenſe of a Godly Fear, as they pitied the Revolt of this Lady, ſo they dreaded the Conſequents, that did hang upon her Power and Opportunity. <hi>Ar. Wilſon</hi> complains, <hi>P.</hi> 275. That the Counteſs of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was the <hi>Cynoſura</hi> that all the Papiſts ſteered by. I believe it was above her Ability to bear the weight of that Metaphor. The common Jealouſie was, that the Duke would be ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreaked with ſpots of Popery, by reſorting to his Mothers Trough. Nay, there was a trivial Gradation in Vulgar Mouths, which reach'd higher, That the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a great Influence upon her Son, the Son upon the King, and the King upon the People. The Lord Keeper did not unforeſee how far this Cord might be drawn: And that thoſe Diſcontents which were but Vapours in common talk, might thicken into a Thunder-Clap in an enſuing Parliament. Which though it aſſembled not in 14 Months after, yet this <hi>Prometheus</hi> had learn'd his Leſſon, That Safety is eaſieſt purchas'd by Prevention. An Inſtrument that is ſtrung, may be us'd upon a little warning. Having thus ſtudied the Welfare of the Duke, he ſpake to him to this effect:</p>

But how far had his Lordſhip been more Fortunate, if he had follow'd better Counſel? Firſt he had made himſelf a leſs Object of their Malice, who look'd with Meager Countenance upon him, for holding ſo many Places of Publick Truſt, Maſterſhip of the Horſe, Admiralty, Wardenſhip of the Cinque Ports: Juſtice in Eyer over all Chaces and Forreſts on this ſide <hi>Trent.</hi> Whereas the Lord Steward ſerves the King only in his Houſhold.

                     </q> So this Lord Admiral was Valiant and feared not his Foes, but <hi>Mars</hi> was not a propitious Aſcendant at his Nativity. He that feared it, and knew him to be both wilful and unskilful, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd him to take a White Staff inſtead of an Anchor; but the Duke return'd him no Gra-mercy, being Reſolute to out Face envy, and as ſecure as a former proſperous Life could make him, to ſuſpect no Ignominy, or Infelicity.</p>
                  <p n="180">180. The week that ſtayed the Parliament being over, it met as it were in the Temple of Concord. Common preſagements ſeldom fail. It came ſo welcom to all Men, that they rejoyced for it according to the Joy of Harveſt. The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity began with a Sermon in the Abby of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> made by Dr. <hi>Carew</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exon.</hi> Even Idolaters did not omit to enter upon any great Work, without ſome Ceremony of Religion,
<q xml:lang="lat">
                        <hi>Omnia levius caſura rebus Divinis procuratis.</hi>
                        <bibl>Tull. l. 2. de divin.</bibl>
                     </q> The Biſhops Theme, upon which he raiſed his Exhortations very prudently, was out of the Words of dying <hi>Jacob</hi> to the Head of one of the Tribes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.13. Zabulon <hi>ſhall dwell at the Haven of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. From which he Preach'd and Pray'd earneſtly it might be conſidered; <hi>Zabulon juxta mare poſitus aliorum videt. naufragia, ſed ipſe ſalvus eſt.</hi> How <hi>Zabulon</hi> might thank God that he ſaw Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and none at home; and that he ſaw many Shipwrack'd at Sea, while he was ſafe in his Haven. But the Stream of Opinion was then againſt his Doctrine. For we think every thing good, whoſe Evil we have not felt. Immediately from thence the Train removed to the Higher Houſe, where the King being ſet under his State, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and other Aſſiſtants of the Court
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49492:89"/>Attending his Royal perſon, and the Lower Houſe being admitted to the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that which was to be ſaid, his Majeſty Feaſted them with a Speech, then which nothing could be apter for the Subject, or more Eloquent for the matter. All the helps of that Faculty were extreamly perfect in him, abounding in Wit by Nature, in Art by Education, in Wiſdom by Experience. Mr. <hi>George Herbert</hi> being Praelector in the Rhetorique School in <hi>Cambridg anno</hi> 1618. Paſs'd by thoſe fluent Orators, that Domineered in the Pulpits of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and inſiſted to Read upon an Oration of King <hi>James,</hi> which he Analyſed, ſhew'd the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinnity of the Parts, the propriety of the Phraſe, the height and Power of it to move Affections, the Style utterly unknown to the Ancients, who could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what Kingly Eloquence was, in reſpect of which, thoſe noted Demagogi were but Hirelings, and Triobulary Rhetoricians. The Speech which was had at the opening of this Parliament; doth commend Mr. <hi>Herbet</hi> for his Cenſure: Which yet I Engroſs not here; for the Reader that is Converſant in Books will find it often Printed. The Sum of it was to ask Advice of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, what was fitteſt to be done for Advancement of Religion, and the good of the Common Wealth, how the Treaty of the Princes Match would agree with theſe, and the good of the Children of the Palatine, for reſtoring them to that which they had loſt. As the whole Contexture was a right Purple Robe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Majeſty, ſo there were three Golden Nails or Studs in it, which even daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Eye with their Splendor. In the Firſt he touchld modeſtly, that his Reign had not been unhappy to us, <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>You have found the Fruits of my Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if you conſider the Peace which my Kingdoms Enjoy, in the midſt of the Miſeries our Neighbours are afflicted with. And though I cannot ſay my Government hath been without Error, yet I can avouch before God and his Angels, never King Govern'd with a more pure ſincerity, and Incorrupt Heart.</hi> In the Second, he Purgeth himſelf from the Detraction of a falſe Rumor. <hi>Jealouſies,</hi> ſays He, <hi>Are of a ſtrange Depth; but let them be far from you. It hath been Talked of my Remiſsneſs in maintenance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Suſpicion of a Toleration. But, as God ſhall Judg me, I never thought or meant it, nor ever in Word Expreſt any thing that Savour'd of it. It is true, That at times beſt known to my ſelf, I did not ſo fully put thoſe Laws in Execution, but did Wink and Connive at ſome things, which muſt have hindred more weighty Affairs. Yet I never in all my Treaties agreed to any thing, to the overthrow and diſagreeing of theſe Laws—For as it is a good Horſman's Part, not always to uſe the Spur, ot keep ſtrict the Reins, but ſometimes to ſpare the Spur, and to hold the Reins more ſlackly, ſo it is the part of a wiſe King (and my Age and Experience have inform'd me) ſometimes to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Laws with ſtrict Execution, and at other times upon juſt occaſion to be more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs. Thirdly, The Shells of a Cockle could not lye cloſer and evener to one another, then theſe laſt laſt words claſp'd with the Parliament: God is my Judg, and I ſpeak it as a Chriſtian King, never any wayfaring men in the Burning, Dry, and Sandy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts more Thirſted for water to quench his Thirſt, then I Thirſt and Long for the Happy Succeſs of this Parliament, that the good Iſſue of this may expiate and acquit the Fruitleſs Iſſue of the former.</hi> The King having ſpread this Banquet to the Taſt of their Judgments, the Lord Keeper <hi>pro formâ</hi> ſet on the Grace Cup as followeth.</p>

And <hi>Saturday</hi> following, the 21ſt of that Month, was but a day of Formality to the Parliament; yet material to this Hiſtory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord Keeper had the greateſt ſhare about the Work of it, who is my Scope; and this Parliament; no further, then as he is concern'd in the Actions and Occurrencies of it. On that day the King Sitting under his State in the Lords Houſe, incircled with the Senatorian Worthies of the higher and lower Order, the Commons Preſented Sir <hi>Tho. Crew,</hi> Serjeant at Law, for their Speaker. As the Knights and Burgeſſes were Choſen for the publick Service out of the beſt of the Kingdom; ſo this Gentleman was Choſen for this Place out of the beſt of them: He was warm in the Care of Religion, and a Chief among them that were popular in the Defence of it; A great lover of the Laws of the Land, and the Liberties of the People; Of a ſtay'd Temper, ſound in Judgment, ready in Language; And though every Man, it is ſuppos'd, hath ſome equals in his good Parts, he had few or no Superiors. This was the Character which the Lord Keeper gave of him to the King, whereupon he was pointed out to this Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Task. Yet with all this Furniſhment, out of a Cuſtom which Modeſty had obſerv'd, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> Deprecated the Burthen, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did when the was to be ſent to <hi>Pharoah, O my Lord, I am not Eloquent, ſend I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt ſend,</hi> Exod. 4.13. And he humbly beſought the Royal Favour to Command a new, and a better Choice for ſo weighty a Charge. Whereupon the Lord Keeper going from his Seat to His Majeſty, and Conferring with Him upon his Knee, after a ſhort time returned to his Place, and ſpake as followeth.</p>

And therefore you may applaud thoſe former Laws of Learning, Piety, Grace, and Bounty, which you handled before: In my Opinion, <hi>Mr. Speaker,</hi> you have kept the good Wine, and the beſt Law of them all till now, which is <hi>Solon's</hi> Law,<hi>Lex Oblivionis,</hi> A Law of Forgetfulneſs, That by His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Grace and Favour freely offer'd unto us the laſt day, all the Memory of theſe Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Abortions may be Buried in the River <hi>Lethe,</hi> and never be had in any further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> For the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> if we regard the Meridian for which it is Erected, it is a Law, as was ſaid of thoſe of <hi>Lycurgus, Diſciplinae Convenientiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimae,</hi> of a moſt apt and convenient Frame, and His Majeſty hath ever ſo approved of it. Nay, He is ſo preciſely affected, and diſpoſed in this kind, that as <hi>Paterculus</hi> writes of <hi>Cato, Id ſolum ei viſum eſt rationem habere, quod haberet Juſtitiam.</hi> He could never allow of any Deviſe or Project, how plauſible ſoever, that was not juſtifiable at the Common Law.</p>
                        <p n="183">183. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> For the Supply of Princes in this Kingdom, His Majeſty makes no Queſtion, but that by Parliament and Subſidy, is the moſt Comfortable to the King, and moſt Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Subject. It Comforts the King, as iſſuing from the Heart; and it Eaſeth the Subject, as brought by the Hands, not of one, or two, but of all the People. That which you call Benevolence, or Good Will, brings unto His Majeſty, neither ſo much Good, nor ſo much Will as the other ſupport. And therefore the Kings of this Land (though it hath
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49492:91"/>been accepted by moſt of them) have made of Benevolence but<hi>Anchoram Sacram,</hi> a help at a dead lift, when Parliaments being great Bodies, and of ſlow Motions, could not ſoon be Aſſembled, nor Subſidies iſſuing from the Purſes of Particulars, be ſo ſuddenly Collected. And it is very well known with what Reluctancy His Majeſty was drawn to ſhoot out this Anchor, never Aſſenting thereunto, until he was in a manner forced by thoſe intolerable Provocations from without, and thoſe general Invitations from whithin the Kingdom. Remember therefore that good Lady, in whoſe Defence the Money was ſpent, that ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Pattern once of Majeſty, but now of Patience to the Chriſtian World, and you will ſay, no Man can be found of that Malevolence, as to find fault with this one Benevolence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seventhly,</hi> His Majeſty Returns you moſt hearty Thanks for your Care and Zeal of the True Religion. And is much Rejoyced to hear, That this Lower Houſe, as it is now Compos'd, is ſuch another Place as <hi>Tully</hi> deſcribes the Town of <hi>Enna, Non Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſed fanum, ubi quot Cives, tot Sacerdotes.</hi> It is no vulgar Houſe, but, as Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, a Sacred Chappel, wherein are Aſſembled in regard of their Zeal and Devotion, look how many Men, ſo many Church-Men. And his Majeſty gives you full aſſurance, that he nothing ſo much Regards the Airy State or Glory of this Life, as he doth that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Jewel of our Religion, which is to remain his only Ornament after this Life. If there be any Scandals to the contrary, not given but taken for want of due Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his Majeſty wiſheth (as <hi>Aphonſo</hi> the Wiſe King of <hi> Aragon</hi> did) <hi>Omnes popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares ſuos reges fuiſſe,</hi> That every one of his People had been a King, for then they might ſoon underſtand, and be as ſoon ſatisfied with the Reaſons of Eſtate. His Majeſty hath never ſpared the Execution of any Law, but for the Execution of a greater Law, to wit <hi>Salus Reip.</hi> the Good, the Peace, and Safety of the Church and Common Wealth. And you know that is the <hi>ultimus finis,</hi> all the reſt are but <hi>fines ſub fine.</hi> For as the Orator well Obſerves, <hi>Nemo Leges legum cauſâ ſalvas eſſe vult, ſed Reipublicae,</hi> We do not deſire the Obſerving of our Laws for the written Laws, but for the Common-Wealths ſake. And for thoſe Statutes made for the preſervation of Religion, they are all (as you heard laſt day from that Oracle of Truth and Knowledg) in full force, and in Free Execution. Nor were ever intended to be connived with in the leaſt Syllable, but for the further propagation of the ſame Religion. <hi>What knoweſt thou O Man, if thou ſhalt ſave thy Wife,</hi> was a Text that gave no Offence in St. <hi>Paul's</hi>time. Remember the King's Simile, which indeed is God's Simile, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.

And it took the more, that it was inlaid with ſuch Moſaick Work, not to the Eye, but to the Ear, by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Orator. It was the greateſt, and the knowingeſt Auditory that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or perhaps the World afforded; whoſe general Applauſe he carried away, to as much as Modeſty could deſire. <hi>Iſocrates</hi> extolling the famous Acts of <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> before the full Celebrity of the Athenians, exulted, that <hi>Evagoras</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by them, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: whoſe good Opinion was more honorable to him, than all the Earths beſide. It was a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſight at that time, to ſee the Patriots of both Houſes depart, with Hands held up to God, and with Smiles in their Looks, that you might think they ſaid one to another, as the Princes of the Congregation, and the Heads of the Thouſands of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid to the Children of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This day we perceive that the Lord is among us,</hi> Joſ. 22.31. The Lord Keeper was ſummoned in three days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a freſh Buſineſs, and a larger Task than the former. So fine a Tongue was ſure not to want Work. The Lords and Commons were brought into the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting-Houſe at <hi>White-Hall, Feb.</hi> 24. where the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſpake unto them, leading them into the <hi>Maeanders</hi> of the Spaniſh Treatiſe, and lead them out of them by the Clew of his own Diligence, as he ſpared not to give himſelf the Honour of it. For this time he was the <hi>Alcibiades</hi> that pleaſed the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. His Zeal and unremovable Pertinacy, not to cope with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Propoſition, unleſs the Prince Elector might be brought into his own Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49492:92"/>with an honorable <hi>Poſt liminium,</hi> did enter inwardly, and into the Marrow of all pitiful Affections. But when he unfolded how ſtrong the Prince was to the Principles of the right Faith, and how attendant and dutious himſelf was to ſee that no Emiſſaries ſhould poyſon his Highneſs's Heart, the general Suffrage was, that the Prince had march'd valiantly like a Captain of Holy Truth, and that the Duke deſerved a great Name as a Lieutenant, that maintained the Cauſe of God under him. For it was ever eaſie to ſtrike the good People of <hi>England</hi> half blind with the Dazling of Religion. So much did the Parliament thirſt for the Report of this Narration, that it was impoſed on the Lord Keeper to make it the next day. All that might be done, was, that he took him to his Memory, and to his Pen, and drew up three Sheets of Paper upon it in a faſt, and ſcarce legible Hand. He muſt proceed by the Pattern. My Lord Duke's Oration was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of Speech he muſt follow; and like a wiſe Man, whatſoever he thought, he muſt make good the time. So he ſpent four hours in Repetition without Halt, with ſuch Aſſurance, ſuch Geſture, ſuch Carving and Gilding, that he might wonder at himſelf what Spirit was in him that day. All that took the height of his Report by a skilful Parallax concluded, that he had ſtriven with his former Peices, and had outgone himſelf. Yet the fourth Part will ſuffice to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, becauſe the Flower of it is anticipated in the Spaniſh Tranſactions after a monthly Method. Beſide, I cannot help the Reader to that which I never ſaw; the ſeveral Letters which were read to the ſtronger Confirmation of every Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Buſineſs; the Contents of them muſt be ſupplied by him that is Wiſe to make Conjecture, and not by my Pen. For though it be not according to Nature, yet it is agreeing to Honeſty, <hi>Vacuum potius relinquere quàm verum;</hi> to leave a void Space, rather than to fill it up with a Fable: as Barrenneſs is incomparably to be leſs blamed than Adultery. So I go on to make ſuch Room as is fit for the Heads of that long Report, which ſhould not ſeem to be unſavory Coleworts, ſod too often for their Taſt, to whom they are well known already. <hi>Debet enim talibus in rebus excitare animos, non cognitio ſolum rerum, ſed recordatio,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Philip</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="186">186. The Lord Keeper plotted his Conceptions into that Order, wherein the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Diſcoverer, had gone before him, beginning from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi> 1622; when the King ſitting cloſe with his Council at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> the Diſpatches of Sir <hi>Richard Weſton,</hi> his Majeſty's Ambaſſador at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> were ſcanned before them. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> being a Man, in whoſe Election to that Place, the Spaniſh Miniſters were greatly pleaſed, and commended the King's Wiſdom, that he did light upon him. Yet Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſent Packet upon Packet, that he found nothing from the Arch-Dutcheſs, but inconſtant and falſe Dealing. For though ſhe acknowledged ſhe had Power from the Emperor to cauſe Ceſſation of Arms in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and undertook to put that Power forth, yet with the ſame Breath ſhe blew hot and cold. For at that Inſtant, when no Excuſe could be made for the Cheat, <hi>Tilly</hi> fell to it ſpightfully, to beſiege <hi>Heidelburg,</hi> when the War was now between the Emperor and our King, for they had no body to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade, but his Majeſty's Subjects and Servants that kept it. And what ſpark of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience could be left us, when by every Poſt we received comfortable Words from <hi>Spain,</hi> and contrary Effects from <hi>Bruſſels?</hi> Hereupon Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> was ſent to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> and commanded to ſtay in that Court but ten Days for an Anſwer. The Letters that he carried with him, were to ſignifie, that this ſhould be the laſt Sending, if no leſs would ſerve the Emperor's Revenge, but the utter Extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majeſty's Children, both in Honour and Inheritance. That the Neighbour Kings and States of Chriſtendom did malign the Match between the Prince and the Inſanta, and laboured to ſtop that Conjunction, which would make <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> formidable to them. But they ſhould not need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way to prevent it: This unſufferable Unkindneſs would bring it to paſs to their hand. For what Comfort could the Prince have in ſuch a Wife, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of whoſe Blood had utterly ruined his Siſter, and her Progeny? The Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger carried this Arrand with him to the Preſident of all Affairs in that Kingdom, <hi>Conde Olivarez,</hi> one that may juſtly be cenſured to have more of Will, than of Wit; one that play'd foul with us, and could not hide it. Sometimes he would run back from our Propoſitions, as if he would never come near us: ſometimes he would run into our Arms, as if his Heart and all his Powers did grow unto us. <hi>Nec conſtans in ſide, nec conſtans in perſidiâ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> came back from him with a half-ſac'd Satisfaction; but withal, the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Letters (which were there read) contained a Talent of Hope; but we found not a Grain of Reality. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49492:92"/>this Journey <hi>Porter</hi> did ſo well remember ſomewhat, that ſell careleſtly from the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke, wiſhing the Prince himſelf were there, to ſee how ready the King his Maſter was to faſten an indiſſoluble Knot of Amity, and embrace Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him; that his Excellent Highneſs (I ſpeak in his Preſence what he knows) hearing it with more Attention than was imagined, put on that heroick and undauntable Boldneſs, craved Leave of his Father, that he might viſit the great Ingeneers at their own Forge, to ſee what they were working, and how they would receive him, and as we uſe to ſay, <hi>Either win the Horſe or looſe the Saddle.</hi> Here again, ſays the Reporter, my Lord Duke acquainted us how acceptable, at the firſt, the Arrival of the Prince did ſeem to <hi>Olivarez,</hi> who in the Enterview in the Garden, aſſured with great Oaths, that all ſhould be diſpatched with ſudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and that his Highneſs ſhould be preſſed to nothing that was not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Conſcience and Honour, and ſtood not with the Love of the People of <hi>England.</hi> Then it was related, That King <hi>Philip</hi> ſeemed moſt ſenſible of the Courteſie, that ſuch a Gueſt had viſited him, and that he would permit all to his own Asking, as he did expreſs it at their Meeting in the <hi>Prado.</hi> The Lord Duke was very copious upon all the Negotiations in <hi>Spain,</hi> from his Highneſs's Arrival, to his Parting, and the Lord Keeper miſt not one Particular, but beautified all, and gave it Luſtre; which may here be ſpared in Repetition, becauſe nothing was added in Subſtance, to that which is methodized upon it in the Months of the former Summer. Much of the Day was ſpent to ſhew how deceitful <hi>Conde Olivarez</hi> was, who, like a crafty Marchant, he gave a Taſt of one Wine, and upon the Bargain would ſell of another. Swear us often into the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and yet embroiled us at the ſame Inſtant more and more with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Waved all Differences of Religion between us and them at the firſt, and preſently turned the Wheel from the Top to the Bottom, and fell into inſolent Propoſitions, that the Prince could not make a fit Husband for their Lady, unleſs he would become a Papiſt. Sometimes he would aggravate, how far we differed from the Catholick Confeſſion of Faith, as if the Gulph reach'd from Heaven to Hell. Sometimes he colleagued as if we were near upon a Point, and but a little Stride between us.

                  <p n="187">187. After this, ſays the Reporter, my Lord Duke hath informed you of the Diſpenſation, the Whirly-Gig of the Diſpenſation, which run round from Pope to Pope, and never could be ſaid to ſettle. And though an orbicular Motion is fitteſt for the Spheres of Heaven, yet a circular Motion, which is ever beginning, and never ending, is ſtark naught for diſpatch of Affairs on Earth. Both the Diſpenſation, and the Labour of the Junto of Divines upon it, and their Fumbling Fingers were never fit to tye a Love-Knot. Nay, the Conde Duke brake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Chaſe againſt their Theologues, that he ſaid the Devil put it into his Head to commit the Matter to their Learning. So that it ſeems the Reſolution of the Divines came quite contrary to the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. The next thing (ſays he) reported out of his Grace's Digeſtions, was the Loathing that the Prince did take at the Length of the Treaty, as well as the Matter; but chiefly at that. In the Matter that he was offered the preſent Conducting of the Lady into <hi>England,</hi> ſo he would ſell his Soul for the Favour, and be a Client to Saints and Images to beg a Bleſſing of them upon his Marriage. And whereas his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had travelled into ſo far a Country, as well to relieve a Siſter and her Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to fetch a Wife, he was at ſuch a loſs about the Loſs of his Siſter's Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that the Spaniſh Council would faſten upon nothing to content him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Highneſs declared himſelf plainly to the <hi>Conde</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>Look to it, Sir, for without this, you muſt not conclude of either Marriage or Friendſhip. For I muſt go to my Father, and acquaint him with your Reſolution.</hi> Here the Lord Keeper grew warm, and beſought their Lordſhips to obſerve, how conſtant his Highneſs remained to the principal Ground of all, the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49492:93"/>was the Hinge upon which all his ſubſequent Actions did move: <hi>Look to it, for neither Marriage nor Friendſhip can be made without the Reſtitution of that Dominion.</hi> Which Proteſtation effecting little good, his Highneſs look'd homeward. But his Purpoſes and Preparations for his Return were often ſlackned. But becauſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> expected a Betrothing with his Siſter before his going away, the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke revived the Treaty for the Reſtitution of the <hi>Paltz.</hi> And after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Emperors Ambaſſadors, there was projected a Reſtitution of the Country to the Son, upon a Condition of a Marriage with the Emperors ſecond Daughter, which the Prince entertained: But then the ſtabbing Condition comes after, That for his Religion he muſt firſt be bred in the Emperors Court, at which his Highneſs ſtopt his Ears. But for the Electorate, it was a thing <hi>in Nubibus,</hi> out of their Power, and it ſeems out of their Affections, for they would not be drawn to meddle in it. And whereas they had once made a chearful Proffer, To aſſiſt us with the Arms, if the Emperor did not keep his Word to put the Prince <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> into his own again: Now they ſlew back, and confeſt the Emperor had been inconſtant, and did not deal well with them; but if he would beat and buffet them, they would not promiſe to employ a Leavy of Forces againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="188">188. Now, ſays the Voice of the Reporter, ſince his Highneſs could prevail for nothing to come on well, his wiſeſt Project was to take care that himſelf might come off well. For which there is not one of your Lordſhips, I preſume, but would have given much, and done much: And it coſt you nothing, but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of ſome Suſpicions and Fears. I ſay, Fear was the worſt you ſuſſer'd. For Religion, God be thanked, ſuffer'd not at all, though it was greatly miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There the Lord Keeper delighted their Expectations in that which they liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after, how the Kings Miniſters, and himſelf principally (for he ſhrunk not in his Head) did proceed from time to time in the laſt Summer, about the Pardon and Diſpenſation, about which the Spaniſh Ambaſſadors ſtruggled for the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants ſake: In Contemplation whereof the Prince had a free and friendly Diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet not a Joint of Religion ſprained, nor a Law actually diſlocated. But as a Wound that is cured by a Weapon Salve <hi>ſine contactu,</hi> ſo the Law was never touch'd, only the Point and Edge of the Weapon a little anointed, and by the Operation of it our Noble Prince paſt the Pikes of Danger, and is come Home to his Fathers Houſe from a far Land, without a <hi>Pater peccavi:</hi> GOD be thanked he neither ſinned againſt Heaven, nor againſt his Father, nor againſt you, nor againſt the Laws or Religion, for which we have cauſe to offer up a great Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to GOD, becauſe there is not a ſpot in the Sacrifice. He goes on then, as the Tract of my Lord the Duke did lead him, and enters into a large Field to rip up that which had been told them before, how near the Prince and the Infanta were drawn together, where the Marriage ſtaid, and upon what Conditions they parted. Which though it had been many Years in Deſtination, (as we were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, and do not yet lay down our Faith) yet if <hi>Conde Olivarez</hi> may be truſted, until they had ſeen the Gallantry of the Prince and his Deſervings, being daily now in their Eyes, they held us with fair Words before, but Performance till then was never meant. Which he made good, at leaſt to his own Opinion, by two Letters; the firſt bears date, <hi>Nov.</hi> 5. 1622. it was the late King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s, as the <hi>Conde</hi> ſaid, read over ſix times by his Highneſs, and Sir <hi>Walter Aſton,</hi> and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of their Memories, (for they were not permitted to excribe it) ſet down in Writing, and I hope, ſays the Lord Keeper, when you conſider the Notary, you will hold it authentical. The ſecond Letter is written with <hi>Olivarez</hi> his own Hand, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 8. 1623. Tranſlated by the Prince himſelf very neatly and exactly. Let the Clerk read them both. Theſe declare the Reſolution of the Spaniſh Court, at leaſt, in my Opinion, that the great <hi>Conde</hi>'s Heart was not with us, till the Prince lodg'd in their Palace, and ſate in Council with them himſelf the laſt Summer. But by that opportunity their Eyes were opened, and they perceiv'd that their Lady, whom they magnifie ſo much, could never make a more happy Wife, than with ſo brave a Husband. So that no doubt the Deſpoſorios, and perhaps the Nuptials, had been paſt by this time with mutual liking, if the ſcandal of invading the <hi>Palatinate</hi> had been removed out of the way. This the Duke's Grace, ſays the Lord Reporter, hath impartially ſpread out, holding a juſt Balance in his Hand: And moſt prudently, knowing that he ſpake in the hearing of the wiſeſt in the Kingdom; and moſt faithfully; for as <hi>Valerian</hi> ſaid of <hi>Poſthumius</hi> in the Hiſtory of <hi>Pollio,</hi> if <hi>Poſthumius</hi> deceive us, <hi>Sciatis nuſquam gentium reperiri, qui poſſit penitus approbari.</hi>

189. But the Unkindneſs of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> intervening, the Prince reſerv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, till he were ſatisfied therein. And at his laſt Farewel engaged himſelf to leave a Proxy, and did depoſite the ſame in my Lord of <hi>Bristol</hi>'s Hand, who ſhould keep it and uſe it as his Proctor, and by his Direction. His preſent Direction was, That if the Confirmation came from <hi>Rome</hi> clear and entire, (which it did not) then within ſo many Days he ſhould deliver it to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> A ſecond Direction was ſent unto him the 8th of <hi>October</hi> 1623. That for fear a Monaſtery ſhould rob his Highneſs of his Wife, he ſhould ſtay the delivery till that were clear'd, and that his Highneſs ſhould ſend him further Direction.

Now becauſe my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> in his Letter <hi>November</hi> 1. 1623. doth preſs ſo vehemently, that the Prince had engaged his Faith and Power not to retract the ſame: And that <hi>Cirica</hi> the Secretary had put it into an Inſtrument, ſign'd and ſeal'd Authentically, I hold it moſt proper in this place to clear that Aſperſion. Firſt, His Highneſs told your Lordſhips plainly and directly, that he had never by Oath or Honour engaged himſelf, not to revoke the Powers, more than by that Clauſe, <hi>De non revocandá procuratione,</hi> included in the Inſtrument it ſelf. Secondly, I muſt let your Lordſhips know, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by the Civil and Canon Law, (and I Appeal herein to thoſe Learned of that Profeſſion now Aſſiſtants to this Noble Houſe) for any Man to revoke his Proxy, (and ſo likewiſe his Reſignation) notwithſtanding that it hath the Clauſe, <hi>De non revocandà Procuratione</hi> inſerted within it. Further and thirdly, I affirm unto you, That though the Prince had ſworn not to ſtay or revoke his Proxy, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Oath, the Revocation is good in Law. <hi>Jurans non rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have digreſſed thus far to let your Lordſhips ſee plainly, that my Lord of <hi>Briſtol</hi> in this Charge upon the Prince hath forgotten himſelf very much; and that his Highneſs might juſtly, honourably, and legally, not only ſtay, as he did; but withal, if he had ſo pleas'd, abſolutely revoke his own Proxy. And now by the Mercy of God, and his own wiſe and judicious Demeanor, his Highneſs is arrived at <hi>Royſton,</hi> and hath made his Narration to the King how that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd an abſolute Freeman, excepting only this one Condition and Limitation, That if his Majeſty may receive ſufficient aſſurance from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> then indeed he is obliged in Honour to go on to the Eſpoſorios. Otherwiſe free every way. Free, becauſe of that which <hi>Olivarez</hi> had promiſed to his Highneſs before the return of Sir <hi>Francis Cottington.</hi> Free, becauſe of what his Highneſs had ſaid to <hi>Olivarez</hi> after the return of Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> being conſtant to the ſame Principle in his dear Siſters behalf. And free, becauſe his Power was ſtaid juſtly, legally, and honourably. His Majeſty was glad (as he had juſt cauſe to be) of this wiſe and very circumſpect Carriage in ſo great a Negotiation; and told his Highneſs that he had played his part very well. And now his Majeſties part came upon the Stage: Which was to provide with all Fatherly Love, that his only Son ſhould not be Married with a Portion of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Daughters Tears. And therefore his Majeſty likewiſe preſently requires the ſtay of the delivery of the Proxy, until he had ſufficient aſſurance for the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> Which your Lordſhips will remember to be no new or ſpringing Condition, but the very ſame that is urged before, and offer'd once by <hi>Olivarez</hi> in a blank Paper to his Highneſs; which Paper was nobly returned by his Highneſs in his laſt anſwer to <hi>Olivarez.</hi> The Proviſion his Majeſty took here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, your Lordſhips ſhall hear out of the Diſpatch from <hi>Royſton, Octob.</hi> 8. 1623.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, The Confirmation came from <hi>Rome</hi> alter'd and mangled. And indeed of ſtopping the Power thereupon, he labours with all his ſtrength of Wit to hide, and palliate the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, When they had alter'd the Portion from 600000 in ready Caſh, to an Yearly Penſion of 200000, and a few Jewels, in ſtead of ſtaying for all upon this Impediment, he ſeems to approve, and applaud the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, For the Aſſurance of the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which is the Foundation of the Marriage and Friendſhip, he is ſo far from providing for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, that he leaves it to be mediated by the Infanta after the Marriage.</p>

That whereas the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did find his Errour in going on with the Treaty of the Marriage, before he had cleared the Treaty of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he is now reſolv'd to change his Method, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this Treaty of the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> before he will proceed any further in the accompliſhing of the Marriage. So that theſe Treatiſes, as they are carried in <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhall be quit one with another. As formerly the Treaty of the Marriage did juſtle out the Treaty of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> ſo now the Treaty of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> hath quite excluded the Treaty of the Marriage.

                              <p>THat are the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of the Houſe of Commons. I am directed by my Lords to open this Conference, with acquainting the Houſe of Commons (with whom their Lordſhips deſire to hold all fair and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Correſpondence) with a double Preface.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Firſt,</hi> with a Supplement to that Narration made by his Highneſs and my Lord the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> his Grace to both the Houſes; and then with an Opinion of their Lordſhips <hi>ſuper totam Materiam,</hi> upon the whole Proceed of the great buſineſs. Now becauſe in this Conſultation the Supplement did co-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with the Narration for the producing of their Lordſhips Opinion, I hold it the beſt Method to begin with that. The Supplement is of a Threefold Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</p>
                              <p>The Firſt Concerns the Treaty of the Marriage.</p>
                              <p>The Second, the Reſtitution of the Palatinate,</p>
                              <p>The Third a moſt Heroical Act and Reſolution of the Princes Highneſs, which their Lordſhips held neceſſary to be imparted, firſt to you the Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Body Repreſentative, and then by you to all the Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>That Supplement which concerns the Treaty of the Marriage is no more but this, That by a Letter of the Earl of <hi>Briſtols</hi> writen Nine Years ago, 3 <hi>Novem.</hi> 1614. it appeared plainly unto their Lordſhips, that this Treaty of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age had the firſt beginning by a Motion from <hi>Spain,</hi> and not from <hi>England,</hi> even from the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> who promiſed all ſincerity in the Match, and as little preſſing as might be in matters of Religion. Yet though the Propoſal began ſo ſoon, and was follow'd ſo earneſtly, it is now like an untimely Birth, for which the Mother endureth a painful Travail, and it enjoyeth not the Fruit of Life.</p>
                              <p>That Supplement which Concerns the Reſtitution of the Palatinate is this, That whereas in that Treaty a demand is preſſed by his Majeſty upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to promiſe us aſſiſtance by Arms, in caſe Mediation ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, it hath appeared to their Lordſhips by the Papers of the Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> preſerved in the Councel-Chamber, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Aſſiſtance by Arms, upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, which notwithſtanding he now utterly refuſeth, and offers but bare Mediation. But as <hi>Symmachus</hi> ſays in an <hi>Ep.</hi> to <hi>Auſonius, Pa. vis nutriment is quanquam à morte defendimur, nihil tamen ad Robuſtam valetudinem promovemur.</hi> We may keep Life, and ſcarce that, with a poor Diet, but we ſhall never grow ſtrong with ſuch a pittance. If the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes of that Honourable Houſe deſire a Sight of theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches, they ſhall be Read unto them.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, That Supplement which tends ſo much to the Honour of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is this. Sometime in <hi>July</hi> laſt, when his Highneſs was in <hi>Spain,</hi> a Rumor was ſcatter'd, that his Highneſs had provided to ſteal away ſecretly, inſomuch that ſome of the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Miniſters were appointed as a Watch to detein him openly, and avowedly as a Priſoner. Hereupon my Lord's Grace was ſent to the whole Committee with this Heroical Remonſtrance, that though he ſtole thither out of Love, he ſcorn'd to ſteal away out of Fear, neither was his Heart guilty of taking ſo poor and unworthy a Courſe. A brave and magnanimous Reſolution; yet ſhort of that which followeth. For the Prince made a diſpatch to his Father at that inſtant, and ſent this Meſſage unto him by Mr. <hi>Grimes,</hi> That if his Majeſty ſhould receive any intelligence, that he was deteined in that State as a Priſoner, he would be pleaſed for his ſake never to think of him more as a Son, but to reflect with all his Royal Thoughts upon the good of his Siſter, and upon the ſafety of his own Kingdoms; <hi>Sic omnes unus amores vicit amor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae.</hi>
                                 <pb n="186" facs="tcp:49492:95"/>And ſo far to the Supplements; I muſt now explicate their Lordſhips O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; who having by the Command of his Majeſty taken into their Mature Conſiderations the whole Narration made by the Prince his Highneſs, and my Lord Duke to both Houſes in this place, and all the Letters and Diſpatches read unto them to corroborate the ſame. And Laſtly theſe Supplements and Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions recited before, are of opinion upon the whole Bulk of the matter; that his Majeſty cannot rely upon, or maintain any longer either of both theſe Treaties, concerning the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with the ſafety of his Religion, his Honour, his Eſtate, or the Weal and Eſtate of his Grand-Children. And his Highneſs together with their Lordſhips, are deſirous to know, whether you Gentlemen, the Knights. Burgeſſes, and Citizens of the Houſe of Commons do concur with their Lordſhips in this their Opinion, which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver referred to this further Conference with your Honourable Houſe.</p>

They opened their Purſe to him; and, which was more beneficial to them, then if they had ſpared a little Mony, he let fall ſome Flowers off his Crown, that they might gather them up, which indeed was no more then <hi>deſluvium pennarum,</hi> the Molting of ſome Feathers, after which the Eagle would Fly the better. He opened his Ear to them in all their Petitions, and they liſtned as much to him; <hi>and gave their Ear-Rings to</hi> Jacob, Gen. 35.4. So the King and the Subject became perfect Uniſons. And as God doth knit his own Glory, and the Salvation of mankind together; ſo the King did imitate God, and Married his Honour with the welfare of the Kingdom.

And all the Land had cauſe of rejoycing, that the Houſe of Commons was never better Repleniſh'd in Man's Memory, with Knights and Burgeſſes of rare Parts and Tempers, eſpecially the Gown-men of the Inns of Courts, who were extoli'd for Knowledge and political Prudence, as no Age had afforded a better Pack. And I give the Lord Keeper his Right and no more, knowing his Traces perfectly at that time, that he labour'd as for Life to keep an Harmony between the King and this Parliament, to ſuck out his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties aſſent to all their Proceedings, that he might ſhew himſelf as good as he was great. Which I think was the greateſt, certainly the happieſt part of Honour, that ever the Lord Keeper Merited. How he mitigated Diſcontents and ſoftned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractorineſs, how he obliged the leading Voices with benefits, how he kept the Prerogative of the Supreme Power, and the Extravagancies of pretended Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the other ſide from Encroachments, the Wiſe only knew (but they that knew it not were the better for it) and that he was chiefly us'd in Conſultation for compiling thoſe wholeſom Laws, which had their double Reſining and Clarify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Lords and Commons.

For nothing was intended but Exchange with conſiderable Advantage to him and his Succeſſors. And that was ſure as touch, becauſe the Houſe was to be paſt by Act of Parliament to the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.

And I conceive that part of the Exchange ſo well ſettled (if the particulars be true, as I probably preſume, and your Grace may better find then I) that your Succeſſors ſhall have good Cauſe to bleſs God for the ſame. Now His Majeſty and the Duke are very willing to fetch in the reſt of the Tenements unto the Houſe, and to deal with you and your See Graciouſly, and bountifully in the Exchange. For when I kneeled before His Majeſty in the preſence of the Prince, and others, to crave Pardon that I ſtood ſo ſtrictly upon Terms of Benefit and Good Accommodation to your Grace, who had Truſted me in this Exchange, the King gave me hearty Thanks for doing ſo, and deſired me that for His ſake and <hi>Buckingham's,</hi> to ſee that your Grace ſhould convey nothing at all to his Majeſty, but that your See ſhould receive back again for the ſame, double Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.

194. All things being agreed upon this Bargain on this ſide <hi>Trent,</hi> and beyond it, an Act is drawn up, and brought into the Houſe of Commons. The Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Exchange is apparent without Fallacy, or Fear of Wrong, and better than the Redemption of a thing ſanctify'd under the Levitical Preſcriptions; yet it ſtuck in the Houſe of Commons, and ſtruggled with great Oppoſition. The King's Counſel pleaded well, that his Majeſty's Lands were more profitable by a good Size, than that which the Arch-Biſhop contributed in lieu; but it was anſwered by a worthy Knight, <hi>Let Caeſar keep that which is</hi> Caeſar's, <hi>and let God keep that which is God's.</hi> And that Scruple was held in diſpute for many days (although the Duke did then appear to be a Perſon that deſerved to be gratify'd) till evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Reaſon, like a Condenſation of Light, did ſhine more and more before them, that Love and Conſcience, tender to preſerve the Church her Rights, ought not to hinder her Augmentation. Or had it been no more than barely one for another, it would be no worſe than with the Man in <hi>Famianus Strada,</hi> that ſneezed once, and blew out his Candle, and ſneezed a ſecond time, and blew it in again. Therefore when the Commons had ſhewn their Good will not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Sacred things, as if the Spirit of thrice honoured Sir <hi>Harry Spelman</hi> had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt them; when they had ſaid much upon it, and received handſome Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when they were at a wit-ſtand, and could reach no further, the Bill was carried by ſome Votes, and the Permutation concluded. A noble Affection to the Biſhops, and to that Portion which our virtuous Progenitors had given them; and little followed within twenty years after, by ſuch as the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. <hi>That walk in the Light of their own Fire, and in the ſparks which themſelves have kindled.</hi> Thoſe Prelates that not long ago had ſo many Friends to ſupport their Demeſns, are now like <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God ſent him into a ſtrange Land, <hi>where he had no Inheritance, no not ſo much as to ſet his Foot upon,</hi> Act. 7.5. Now thoſe Mannors and Houſes which were kept entirely for them, are ſold to make Payment, 'tis well known to whom. But ſuch Work, ſuch Wages. Publick and Private, Civil and Sacred Lands, Civil Wars can gulp down all. And yet the Grecians, that knew not the true God, invited all to take Arms againſt the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes,</hi> in the Quarrel of Sacriledge, and called it the Sacred War. When the whole Eſtate of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great was Confiſcate, after <hi>Caeſar</hi> had prevailed in the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Battle, ſays <hi>Tully, Philip 2. Qui ad illud ſcelus ſectionis auderet accedere, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus eſt nomo praeter Antonium:</hi> None could be found ſo impudent to buy his Lands, but <hi>Antony.</hi> But enow are found in theſe Dominions that are ready to buy Gods Lands: Their Peny-worths are cheap, if there were no Account to be made to the Lord of the Vineyard hereafter. Theſe Huxters cannot chuſe but think of it; and if any of them ſhould ſay he did not drive this Trade, at leaſt with a doubting Conſcience, <hi>in good Faith</hi> I would not believe him 'Tis the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of the Devil, when he cannot hinder Reformation, to diſcredit it with Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And he is cunning at that horrid Sin, ever ſince he mixt it in his firſt Temptation. For the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which was not to be eaten, had a Sacramental Signification in it, and ſtood in <hi>Paradice</hi> for an Holy Purpoſe, and was an holy Poſſeſſion; in regard whereof, to eat of the forbidden Fruit, was Theft in the Act, and Sacriledge in the Circumſtance. But ſuppoſe a Church be unſound, ſurfeited, and fit to be purged of Offences; What Phyſician that undertook to cure a ſick Man, did ever plunder him of all that he had for his Fee? Who will think elſe that his Heart was ſet upon the Good of his Patient, and not upon filthy Lucre? He that reaps down Errors, and fills his Barns with golden Sheaves, he works for <hi>Mammon,</hi> and not in God's Harveſt.

Then as the Earth is the Lords in all its Fulneſs, ſo the true Church is Chriſt's in all its Penury and Emptineſs. And this is enough to let
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49492:96"/>the Reader ſee what was intended to be made good before, that a moſt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loving, was a moſt happy Parliament.</p>
                  <p n="195">195. Yet no feaſt was ever ſo bountiful, but ſome went away unſatisfied; and no Court was ever ſo Righteous upon Earth, but ſome Appellants thought they were prejudiced. If any man had Cauſe to complain of the Juſtice of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Cranfield.</hi> About whoſe Tryal, if I ſhould ask, as the <hi>Phariſes</hi> did about Divorces, Is it lawful to cenſure a principal Officer for eve-Cauſe? I muſt ſay as Chriſt anſwered them, <hi>From the Beginning it was not ſo.</hi> A Parliament is a Judge among Gods; a Terror to Magiſtrates, that are a Terror to any, but to them that deſerve Evil; the only, or the beſt Inquiſitor into the Ways of them that Rule in high Places, that he that ſtands may take heed leaſt he fall. But if it grow common, if every Seſſion make it their Work, or their Recreation to hunt ſuch Game down, and root up Cedars, that might have ſtood without Offence; Moderation will be deſired, and the Prudent will think it is not fit, many a Week ſhould be loſt anent the providing of good Laws, when a Month or two paſs over in bringing a white Staff, or ſome ſuch Grandee, to the Stake, to be baited by Informers. The Lord Treaſurer had ſome Petitions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred againſt him in <hi>March,</hi> which at firſt he laugh'd at, and thought to ſcorn them down with Unguiltineſs. For who regards the firſt Grudgings of a Sickneſs? Yet none periſh ſooner than they that are not provident againſt the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of an Evil. The Petitioners were countenanced, becauſe he, whoſe Harm they ſought, was one that was not beloved. 'Tis true, he was ſurly, and of hard Acceſs. But be it remembred, he ſate in his great Places, not to be popular, and get Affections, but to be Juſt, and to Husband the Revenue of the Crown with Prudence. But ſubtle Knavery is like to be longer unqueſtioned, than rough-caſt Innocency. He was charged with Corruption, and ſordid Bribery; all the while many Sages contended that the Proofs came not home to a full Diſcovery. One preſs'd it cloſe, that he gave him Five hundred Pound to break well through a long Suit in the <hi>Court of Wards.</hi> To which the Treaſurer anſwered, <hi>That the Money was paid him for a Place in the Cuſtom-Houſe, for which the Complainant had often moved him, which his Secretaries, and other Witneſſes, made good, and that upon the Payment of that Sum, one of the Six and thirty Portions in the Cuſtom-Houſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him.</hi> Albeit, the weight of this ſuſpected Bribe (not a Bur hanging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Gown beſide) preſs'd him down in the Concluſion. This was not to turn Foxes into Fleas a Bed, as <hi>H. Grotius</hi> doth in his Notes upon the <hi>Canticles;</hi> but it is to turn Fleas into Foxes, or rather Flea-bites into the mortal Spots of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Whether the Treaſurer had great Faults, it is uncertain, and waits Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; but 'tis ſure he had great Adverſaries. The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> and all his Party appeared againſt him. Whereupon Sir <hi>A. Wel.</hi> the moſt virulent Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Lord Treaſurer, writes, <hi>That a ſmall Accuſation, as his was, would ſerve to turn him out of his Honor, whom the Duke did then oppoſe.</hi> But why did his Grace heave at his Couſin by Marriage? 'tis very dark. It ſeems the Courtiers had no Mind to let us know it. For as <hi>Lampridius</hi> Notes in <hi>Vit. Alex. Sev. Secreta omnia in aulâ eſſe cupiunt, ut ſoli aliquid ſcire videantur.</hi> It is perhaps, that the Treaſurer would have brought a Darling, Mr. <hi>Arthur Bret,</hi> his Counteſs's Brother, into the King's Favour, in the great Lord's Abſence. Or that he grudg'd that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury was exhauſted in vaſt Iſſues by the late Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> and denied ſome Supplies: Or that he dealt too plainly at the Council-Table, in giving no kind Ear to his Couſin's Relations of his Doings at <hi>Madrid,</hi> having not the Art to catch his Affections in the Springes of Flattery. But down the Duke caſt him, as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeems, being not aware, how every man hath ſo many Relations, that he that deſtroys one Enemy, makes himſelf ten more. Or as I heard another ſay long ago much better upon it, that my Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi> did never undo any of his Enemies, but he ruin'd many of his Friends. And in this Lord's Overthrown, the Prince abetted him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was Privy to the Undertakings of his Adverſaries, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed Suffrages to Condemn him.

                     </gap>ain to Comment upon it. That the Prince diſcerned ſo much Juggling in the Parliament, in <hi>Cranfield</hi>'s Caſe, that it was not much to be wondred at, being come to be King, that he did not affect them. King <hi>James</hi> being all that time of this Storm, not at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> as our late Miſtakers ſay, but at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> was ſo ſad, that a truſty Servant, and an able, ſhould be thus handled, forced from him and quipt every day with ignominious Taunts that the kind Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies between him and the Parliament began to have a Cloud over them. He courted many to take ſide with his Treaſurer, and prevailed little, becauſe the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49492:97"/>moſt did love to warm themſelves in the Light of the Riſing Sun. He tutored his Son, the Prince, that he ſhould not take part with a Faction in either Houſe, but ſo reſerve himſelf, that both Sides might ſeek him; and chiefly to take heed, how he bandied to pluck down a Peer of the Realm by the Arm of the Lower Houſe, for the Lords were the Hedge between himſelf and the People; and a Breach made in that Hedge, might in time perhaps lay himſelf open. But the Duke had thruſt on the Prince ſo far, that he could not retreat, elſe the Treaſurer had been reſcued by the Power and Juſtice of his Royal Maſter. His Majeſty perceived that the Actions of this unfortunate Man, rack'd with the ſtricteſt Enquiries, were not Sins going over the Head, ſcarce reaching to the Ankles, and why ſhould he ſuffer him to ſink under the Waves of Envy? Therefore he ſent for the Lord Keeper to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and gave him his Senſe: That he would not make his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer a publick Sacrifice. <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays the Lord Keeper, <hi>I have attempted, among my ſureſt Friends, to bring him off fairly. All ſhrink, and refuſe me; only the ſtout and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Lord</hi> Hollis <hi>adventured upon the Frowns of the Prince and Duke, and gave his Reaſons why</hi> Middleſex <hi>to him appeared an Innocent. I were mad, if, for my part, I ſhould not wiſh him to eſcape this Tempeſt, and be ſafe under the Harbor of Your Majeſty's Clemency.</hi> Suam quiſque fortunam in conſilio habet, quando de alienâ deliberat. <hi>Curt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>When I deliberate upon him, I think of my ſelf. 'Tis his Fortune to day, 'tis mine to morrow. The Arrow that hits him, is within an Handful of me. Yet Sir, I muſt deal faithfully: Your Son, the Prince, is the main Champion that encounters the Treaſurer; whom, if you ſave, you foil your Son. For though Matters are carried by the whole Vote of Parliament, and are driven on by the Duke, yet they that walk in</hi> Weſtminſter-Hall, <hi>call this the Prince's Undertaking, whom you will blaſt in his Bud, to the Opinion of all your Subjects, if you ſuffer not your old, and perhaps innocent Servant to be pluck'd from the Sanctuary of Your Mercy.

The Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi> was removed, and he that preſided over the great Accounts, did now ſtand for a Cipher. The Lord Keeper perceived his turn was next; although he wanted not fair Words, and fair Semblance from the Contriver. But an Ambuſh is more dangerous than a pitch'd Battel, becauſe it is hid, unleſs the Leader look about him in his March, and ſearch every Hedge by Vant-curriers, as he did.

The Keeper knew he had deſerved no ill; yet he truſted not to that, for he knew likewiſe how a Judge that hears many Cauſes, muſt condemn many, and offend many. And if Juſtice ſhould ſhrink in, to decline Offences, what were it ſo like unto, as to one in the Fable, that would feed upon nothing but Spoon-meat, becauſe he would not wear out his Teeth? He was not ignorant of the laudable, or at leaſt the durable Cuſtom of the Commons, to countenance all Proſecutors, and to file the Medly of all Complaints. Therefore this <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> kept a careful Watch to repulſe Embroilments as much as he could; for though he had a ſound Bark, yet none but a phrantick Pilate would be willing to be toſs'd in a Storm.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49492:97"/>to mortifie thoſe ſpiteful accuſations (if any ſuch hapned) with his Frown, that durſt not ſtand the Breath of Truth. Concerning the Duke, he was not ſo ſilly to look any longer upon himſelf, as growing on the former Root of his Favour; yet he was not ſo rude to expoſtulate with him, according to the Merit of his Unkindneſs, and provoke him further; but as it occurs, <hi>Cab.

He tells his Lordſhip, That Suſpicions of his Diſpleaſure, tranſported him not a Jot further, than to look about him, how to defend himſelf: that he begg'd Aſſurance of his Grace's former Love, yet not in the leaſt deſire to crave the Patronage of any corrupt, or unjuſt act of his, that ſhould be objected againſt him in Parliament; nor to take Refuge to him in any Cauſe or Clamor, otherwiſe than according to Juſtice and fair Proceeding. A ſufficient Number of other Friends were made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to him by his Wiſdom and Deſervings, whom he never requeſted (as he had no need of it) to make a Side for him; but to be intentive to diſcloſe ſuch Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſinuations, which are apt to twine about ſome weak Underſtandings. This Forecaſt made him ſtand unmoveable and unaffrighted, when Petitions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of Perdue-Cauſes were entred againſt him. <hi>They came about him like Bees, and were extinct like Fire among the Thorns.</hi> And what were they that made a Noiſe with their Grievances? <hi>Itane nihil fortunam puduit, ſi minus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſatae innocentiae, at accuſantium wilitatis?

After a while, a Bundle of thoſe frivolous Objections being read and examined, were caſt out of Doors, and the Houſe, in the Afternoon, being put into a general Committee, Seven and thirty of thoſe Paper-Kites ſlew away that ſame day, and were never heard of more. Some of the Members would have repaired the Lord Keeper, and asked him what he would have done to his Adverſaries? <hi>Nothing,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for by this time they have all fretted themſelves into Patience, and ſome of them, perhaps, into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> Which proved even ſo: For many of them came privily to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Favour, condemned their own ſcandalous Petitions, and laid it upon a great Name, that they were encouraged to bring them in, whom he caſt off, as a Man would do a beſmeered Dog, that deſiles him with his Fawning. Some, I know, will ſay, Why did he not bring thoſe Caitives to Submiſſion, or to ſome open Diſgrace?

For whoſe Pardon the Lord Keeper ſued, but with no Succeſs; their Lordſhips telling him plainly, That they would not be entreated in ſuch a Varlets Behalf. <hi>Crates,</hi> as <hi>Laertius</hi> relates it, was wounded in the Face by <hi>Nicodromus,</hi> a Fidler: To divulge the Injury, <hi>Crates</hi> clapt a Paper upon his own Forehead, like a Plaiſter, and wrote upon it in great Letters, <hi>haec fecit</hi>

                     <hi>Nicodromus: Nicodromus</hi> had given him that Mark. A moſt hair-brain'd Revenge for a ſerious Philoſopher to take. But the Keeper made ſlight of the ſcratch that <hi>Morley</hi> had given him, and interceded for the Delinquent, that his Forehead might not carry a White-Paper upon it in the Pillory. But he was one of a hard Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the Shame could not be ſhunned: Of which Grief <hi>Morley</hi> died within a Year after, and on his Death-bed proteſted to a Reverend Divine, by what mighty Authority he was ſet on.

So the Lord Keeper had as much Succeſs in theſe Combats, as he could wiſh; for all gave him Honour by the Invalidity of their Oppoſition. There was one more that hunted him cloſe, <hi>Sed tergo decut it haſtas.</hi> Aen. li. 10. It was a Lady, but a <hi>Virago; And</hi> Abimelech <hi>would be loth to have it ſaid, that he periſht by the Hand of a Woman,</hi> Jud. 9.54. It was the Lady <hi>Darcies</hi> Charge, which was the moſt dangerous that aemulous Power could raiſe againſt him. For it was upon the ſtopping of an Original Writ, which is every Mans Inheritance, and the only way by which the Subjects wrongs are to be redreſſed, and theſe of courſe are iſſued out of the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> which gives occaſion to that Maxim in the Law, <hi>Nemo recedit à Cancellariâ ſine remedio.</hi> The Caſe came to this Head. The Rectory of <hi>Sutton</hi> in the County of <hi>Surry</hi> was void by the Death of the Incumbent. The Right of Donation was in Mr. <hi>Ed. Darcy,</hi> but under Age, and the Kings Ward.

The Lady Mother, (for Mr. <hi>Wilmore</hi> ſtirr'd not) allegeth that ſhe had compounded for the Wardſhip of her Son, and had procured in her Compoſition the Donation of that Living; which neither was ſo, nor ought to have been granted both to the prejudice of the Lord Keeper, and the Maſter of the Wards. She tries to enforce her Right by way of <hi>Quare impedit;</hi> which was the right way to Commence her Suit, and to try her Title. The Lord Keeper Commands the Officer not to iſſue forth the Writ, it being ſo appointed under the Kings Signet, as it followeth.</p>

                  <p>When theſe Proceedings were Canvaſs'd in the Houſe of Commons, the Lord Keeper makes Anſwer;
<q>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Lady</hi> Darcy <hi>had no Injury done to her in her Title.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nor,</hi> Secondly, <hi>Any Injury by the</hi> Quare impedit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Though it bad a ſhew of Injury, the Court of</hi> Chancery <hi>was bound to proceed ſo, leaſt it ſhould do it ſelf a greater Injury.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
To the former he declares, That the Lady <hi>Darcy,</hi> and <hi>G. Wilmore</hi> Ex. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of the Kings Ward, took a Leaſe from the King of the Wards Lands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Seal of the Court of Wards. And by other Indentures of the ſame date Covenanted with the King as followeth. <q>That if any Spiritual Promotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſaid Heir happen to be Void, before he come and be of his full Age of Twenty one years, that then the ſaid Committees, or their Aſſigns, ſhall, within one Month next after Knowledge by them had of any ſuch Diſcent or Vacation, give knowledge thereof to the ſaid Maſter and Council of the Court of Wards, ſo as the Kings moſt Gracious Pleaſure may be known for the juſt Order and Diſpoſition of the ſame.</q> And there is another Proviſo in the Leaſe to the like Effect, with ſome Alteration, that the Allowance of the Maſter and Council of the Court of Wards be had, for a ſit, and apt Clerk to be preferred
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49492:98"/>to the ſame. Hence it plainly appears by the ſaid Covenant, and Proviſo, that the ſaid Committees, as to the Advouſon of the Church of <hi>Sutton,</hi> belonging to the ſaid Ward, are but Leſſees in Truſt, to preſent ſuch a Clerk to the ſame, as the King, or the Maſter and Council of the Court of Wards for the King, ſhall Name or Appoint. Then it is Pregnant, That the Clerk being refuſed, whom the Lady offered to the Rectory without the Kings Conſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Injuſtice is offered.</p>
                  <p n="199">199. He rejoyns to the Second, That the ſaid Church being become Void, the Lord Keeper by Virtue of his Place, as time out of mind hath been uſed, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Grant</hi> the Kings Chaplain in his Majeſties Name. The Maſter of the Wards preſented likewiſe. Dr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> in the Kings Name, to the ſame Church: But Dr. <hi>Grant</hi> was firſt preſented, admitted, and Dr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> gave way. After both theſe, the Committees preſent their Clerk in their own Name, and pray a <hi>Quare Impedu</hi> to remove the Kings Clerk, and to have their own Clerk admitted in his room. This <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> by the Kings Commandment to the Lord Keeper, was denied them. For which much is alledged. Lands in Queſtion in <hi>Chancery</hi> were Decreed by the Lord <hi>Ellſmore</hi> to <hi>Peacock,</hi> in Equity againſt <hi>Revell,</hi> who had a good Title in Law. <hi>Revell</hi> would have had an Original Writ of Aſſiſe againſt <hi>Peacock,</hi> to have recover'd the Lands from him by Law. The Writ was denied him by the Lord <hi>Ellſmore.</hi> If <hi>Revell</hi> would have made a Leaſe, or a Feoffment to any Friend in truſt, which Friend would have ſued for an Original Writ, to have recover'd the Land, the Writ might as well be denied to him, as to <hi>Revell</hi> himſelf. So the Maſter of the Wards preſented a Clerk to the Church of <hi>Sutton</hi> in the Kings Name, before the Lord <hi>Darcy</hi> preſented: If that Clerk would have ſued for a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> in the Kings Name, the Lord Keeper by the Kings Appointment might have denied the Writ. And by the ſame Reaſon may he in like manner deny the Writ to the Lady <hi>Darcy,</hi> who as to the Advouſon is but a Leſſee in truſt, to preſent ſuch a Clerk, as the Maſter of the Wards for the King ſhall name: As by the Covenant and Proviſo in the Leaſe doth appear. If Lands in Queſtion in the <hi>Chancery</hi> be, by Order of the Court by both Parties conveyed to one of the Six Clerks in truſt, that he ſhall convey the ſame, as the Court ſhall Order upon the hearing of the Cauſe, who refuſeth to convey the Land according to the truſt, and prayeth a Writ of Aſſiſe to recover the Land from him, to whom the Court hath order'd the ſame, (for the truſt appears as plainly to the Court, as in the Caſe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;) This Writ may be denied. So the Lady <hi>Darcy</hi> being a Leſſee of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſon in truſt to preſent ſuch a Clerk as the King, or the Court of Wards ſhall name or allow of, if ſhe will preſent a Clerk of her own, contrary to the truſt repoſed in her, and ſue for a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> to remove the Clerk preſented by the King, and to put in her own choice, this Writ by the Kings Appointment may be denied her; for the truſt appears of Record. So if Bonds be taken of a Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in <hi>Chancery</hi> in the Name of a Maſter of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> with Condition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Order or Decree of the Court: The Court Decrees Money to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff at a Day, who pays the ſame the next Day after, which the Plaintiff accepts, and the Court allows of. If the Maſter of <hi>Chancery</hi> will pray an Original Writ of Debt upon this Bond, to recover the Money to his own uſe, this Writ may be denied him. The Lord <hi>Ellſmore</hi> preſented a Clerk in the Kings Name <hi>Ratione Minoris AEtatis;</hi> The Lady <hi>Mordant</hi> pretended Title to preſent, and having four Feoffees in truſt of the Mannor or Lands, to which the Advouſon did belong, as ſhe pretended, would have had four Writs of <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt the Kings Clerk, in the Names of her four Feoffees ſeverally. The Lord <hi>Ellſmore</hi> denied them all. There are many more Precedents to be ſhewed in like Caſes, where Original Writs have been denied.</p>
                  <p n="200">200. Yet ſince it is to be done with great Tenderneſs and Diſcretion, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never, but when it appears that one Injury muſt be prevented neceſſarily with another, he declares, Thirdly, That the Lady <hi>Darcy</hi>'s Proceedings thruſt in ſo dangerouſly between two great Courts, that ordinary Juſtice could not but be denied her, for fear an extraordinary Difference ſhould be raiſed between the ſaid Courts, being thus laid open. When the Lord <hi>Ellſmore</hi> was Lord Chancellor, and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Maſter of the Wards, there fell out a Conteſtation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Potent Lords, whoſe Right it was to preſent to the Wards Livings, which were under Value of 20 <hi>l.</hi> in the Firſt-Fruit-Office: And the Contention grew ſo inſoluble, that King <hi>James,</hi> with all his Pacificous Wiſdom, could not readily light upon a way to reconcile it. Yet at the laſt it was compounded thus, That which ſoever of thoſe two Officers ſhould firſt preſent to ſuch a Benefice, his
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49492:99"/>Preſentation ſhould be Valid for the Poſſeſſion of the Living. If both Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould come together to the Biſhop, (which perhaps would not happen in an Age) then there was <hi>Caſus pro amico</hi> on the Biſhop's behalf, as the Canoniſts ſpeak. This Agreement had continued amicably to that very Day, and was then in danger to be infring'd. For if a Suit had commenced, as the Lady deſired, the Lord Keeper could not avoid to charge the Court of Wards with Fraudulency, in paſſing away the Donations of Livings in the Compoſitions for Wards, which was a pre-occupating, or rather plain deluding of the Patronage, which was in the Lord Keeper by the Agreement. Wherefore he waves the ſtrong and full defence he had made upon the ſtopping of an Original Writ, and deprecates all offence by that Maxim of the Law, which admits of a miſchief rather than an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. Which was as much as to ſay, That he thought it a far leſs Evil, to do the Lady the probability of an Injury, (in her own ſenſe) than to ſuffer thoſe two Courts to claſh together again, and fall into a new Diſpute about their Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which might have produc'd a publick inconvenience, which is moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided. This Plea ſatisfied the Houſe and cleared him in the general Opinion; or as ſome Interpreted, excus'd him rather for his other good Parts, then abſolutely cleared in this intricate Point, as <hi>Livie li.</hi> 1. ſays, <q>
                        <hi>Horatius</hi> eſcaped Sentence by the Voice of the people, becauſe they loved his Perſon, rather then lik'd the Fact upon which he was queſtion'd, <hi>Abſolveruntque admiratione magis virtutis, quam jure Cauſae.</hi>
                     </q> Yet it goes ſtrongly to juſtifie the Lord Keeper in the Fact, that all the Lawyers in the Houſe did unanimouſly concur to propugn him. And in fine this great complaint produc'd but ſmall Effect, towards that for which it was ſo vigorouſly follow'd. The cloſe of all is the beſt part of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Lady <hi>Darcy,</hi> ever impotent in her Paſſions, and the more in this Caſe, becauſe ſhe could not endure the Calling, and hated the Honour of a Biſhop, was even diſtracted with Anger, that ſhe was croſs'd in her will; whom the L. Keeper mitigated with ſuch Sweetneſs and Generoſity, that ſhe came out of her froward Mood, and confeſs'd ſhe had had no cauſe to be his Enemy. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whilſt the Cauſe was hot in Agitation, he ſent to her Ladyſhip to let her know, <q>That if ſhe would accept of the Living from him, and in his Right he would diſpoſe of Dr. <hi>Grant</hi> in ſome other Place, and preſent her Clerk Mr. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
                     </q> But her Ladyſhip would not hearken; her thoughts were too high; for the cauſe was depending, ſhe hop'd to obtain it with Dr. <hi>Grant's</hi> Ejection, and his Patrons Ruin. After all was cleared againſt her, and ſhe found her ſelf at a loſs of her expectation, the Lord Keeper ſent to her upon the Old Terms, <q>That if ſhe would ſubmit to have right done her in the right way, and take the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from him; let her ſend the Man to him for whom ſhe had contended in vain, and it ſhould be effected;</q> which ſhe accepted of very gladly, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity had taught her Wiſdom, and a milder Temper. In all this his Lordſhip ſhew'd that he had no particular Spleen againſt the Lady, not the leaſt aim to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her with his Power, but his Scope was to preſerve the Juriſdiction of his Court (in which he was ever ſtiff and unvanquiſhable) and when that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, it was an Heroick Spirit in him to paſs by a moſt violent proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if it had never concern'd it. It was an Object ſit to prove all the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Chriſtian forgiveneſs. For what more true then that of <hi>Pliny</hi> to <hi>Sabinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> as I have cited it before, <hi>Ep. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Tune praecipua manſuetudinis laus, cum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="201">201. Let all now be drawn up into a Word; no Garland could look more freſh upon a Magiſtrates Head then this, that being narrowly look'd into by the Eyes of all the Kngdom, nothing was amiſs, nothing out of Frame in all his Carriage; which Credit ſtuck ſo cloſe to him in the next Parliament, in which he ſtill kept the Great Seal, <hi>That not ſo much as a Dog did open his Mouth againſt him,</hi> Judith 11.19. Nor was awak'd out of ſecurity with the leaſt Whiſper of a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. Yet I am as ready to ſay it as another, that to be acquit from having done no ill, is a Teſtimony of harmleſs, not of fruitful Honeſty. I admire <hi>Coriolanus</hi> for that Elogy in <hi>Halicarn: Vix inter virtutes numeravit innocentiam.</hi> He ſcarce reckon'd Innocency for a Virtue. Innocency is none of the Artillery of Virtue, with which it tries and ſhews it's ſtrength, but only a privy Coat, to keep a Man from being Wounded. I bring him forth therefore from this ſhade into the light of Action, in an inſtance wherein he did ſo well, that it will break forth, that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49492:99"/>he had a Wit which was ſuch a ſudden Architect of Deviſes, ſo apt in a pleaſant cunning, ſo full of Pit-falls to catch the Bird he would ſnare, yet not to hurt it, as never a Head-piece in this Nation could overtake him in that ingenuity. And the ſucceſs ſuited with the Stratagem, Fortune favouring it to the help of his beſt Friends, the continuation of a Happy Parliament, and the enlightning of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty who was ſtricken far into Melancholly by a perſidious contrivance, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate, born in an ill day in the Spaniſh Embaſſadors Houſe; which Family was vext to the Gall, becauſe their Nation was curried in Parliament, and moſt of all, that the Match, the Treaty, and Friendſhip with them, were handled there, as the Prince and Duke had ſet them on, with ſharp and declamatory diſdeigns. Therefore they caſt about to infect the King with an ill opinion of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and the perſons; and like deſperate men, they look'd for Redreſs from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and ſafety from Confuſion.

But his Majeſty's Sorrow increaſed, while it was ſmothered; and Fear ſet in apace, till a wiſe Remonſtrance reſiſted it. And it was no Wonder that he was abuſed a while, and dim ſighted with a Character of Jealouſie: For the Parliament was about to land him in a new World, to begin and maintain a War, who thought that ſcarce any Miſchief was ſo great, as was worth a War to mend it. Wherein the Prince did deviate from him, as likewiſe in Affection to the Spaniſh Alliance, but otherwiſe promiſed nothing but Sweetneſs and Obedience. He ſtuck at the Duke moſt of all, whom he defended in part to one of the Spaniſh Miniſters; yet at the ſame time complained, that he had noted a turbulent Spirit in him of late, and knew not how to mitigate it. Thus caſting up the Sum, he doubted it might come to his own Turn to pay the Reckoning. The Setters on expected that their Pill could not chooſe but have a moſt violent Operation. And it wrought ſo far, that his Majeſty's Countenance fell ſuddenly, that he muſed much in Silence, that he entertained the Prince and Duke with myſtical and broken Speeches. From whence they gathered all was not right; and queſting for Intelligence, they both heard that the Spaniſh Secretary, and the Jeſuit <hi>Maeſtro</hi> had been with him, and underſtood that ſome in the Ambaſſador's Houſe had vaunted, that they had net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Duke, and that a Train would take Fire ſhortly to blow up the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. While his Majeſty was gnawn with this Perplexity, he prepared for <hi>Windſor,</hi> to ſhift Ground for ſome better Eaſe in this Unreſt, and took Coach at St. <hi>James</hi>'s-Houſe-Gate in the end of <hi>April,</hi> being <hi>Saterday</hi> Afternoon. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Son into the Coach, and ſound a ſlight Errand to leave <hi>Buckingham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; as he was putting his Foot in the Boot, which brought Tears from him, and an humble Prayer, that his Majeſty would let him know, what could be laid to his Charge, to offend ſo gracious a Maſter, and vowed it, by the Name of his Saviour, to purge it, or confeſs it. The King did not ſatisfie him in it; it ſeems

Which News were no ſooner brought, but he ſought out the Duke at <hi>Wallingford-Houſe,</hi> and had much ado to be admitted to him in his ſad Retirement: Whom he found laid upon a Couch, in that immoveable Poſture, that he would neither riſe up, nor ſpeak, though he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to it twice or thrice by courteous Queſtions. The Lord Keeper gave his Grace the Faith of a deep Proteſtation, that he came purpoſely to prevent more Harm, and to bring him out of that Sorrow into the Light of the King's Favour. That he verily believed God's directing Hand was in it, to ſtir up his Grace to advance him to thoſe Honours which he poſſeſs'd, to do him Service at this Pinch of Extremity. He beſought his Grace to make haſte for <hi>Windſor,</hi> and to ſhew himſelf to his Majeſty before Supper was ended; to deport himſelf with all amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addreſſes, not to ſtir from his Perſon Night nor Day. For the Danger was, that ſome would thruſt themſelves in, to puſh on his Majeſty to break utterly with the Parliament; and the next Degree of their Hope, was, upon that Diſſolution, to ſee his Grace committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and then God knows what would follow. The Keeper adjured his Lordſhip to lock up this in his own Breaſt, which was imparted as charily to him, as under the Seal of Secrecy; but to be quick and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious in the Prevention, more was not to be ſaid, becauſe loſs of time might looſe all. The Duke parted with many Thanks, and lingred not but came to <hi>Windſor,</hi> before he was look'd for.

But all the while his Fancy was Whiſtling to another Tune, how he might play his Game diſcreetly: He held the Prince his Cards, and would not for his Life that he ſhould looſe. He had well conſider'd, and brought the Caſe to this Touch ſtone of Judgment, that he ſhould never know how the whole Scene had been Acted but by Secretary <hi>Franciſco</hi> He had requeſted him to refrain his houſe above the whole ſpace of a Month.

The Prieſt was apprehended and laid up: The Man that was dearer to <hi>Franciſco</hi> (which the Lord Keeper know) then his own Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, or any of that Coat; which made him wild when he heard of the miſchance; for he knew the Law, and how hard it would be to ſave his Life, if he came to be Tried at the Seſſions, the Parliament then Sitting. He was in a fort baniſh'd from the Keepers Houſe, and he a poor Stranger knew not to whom elſe to turn him, to implore Mercy in his Friends behalf. Howſoever he ſaw it was no time to obſerve the Niceneſs of Modeſty, but ſent his Requeſt to the Lord Keeper to be admitted that day, though he ſhould never ſee his Face again. With a ſeeming unwillingneſs it was allowed him, keeping a cautious limit, not to make his Viſit till Eleven of the Clock that Night, and by the back door of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where a Servant ſhould receive him. He came at his hour, and being brought into a Gallery, fell into an abrupt <hi>Exordium,</hi>

Pick'd out of him at that time, the Heads of all the Articles in the Paper, with all Reaſons, Circumſtances, diſtorted Proofs, and Expoſitions to confirm them. The Copy of the main Paper, ſcratched in ſome places with <hi>Don Carlo Colonna's</hi> Hand (for the Keeper knew his Writing) was not brought him till four Nights after. He had enough of their Brewing at the firſt running; for he kept <hi>Don Carendelet</hi> till two of the Clock in the Morning, and let him not part, till he had ſqueez'd him dry. But to gratifie his Information, he call'd for the Purſivant, a Reſerve at Hand, and bad him immediately Releaſe the Prieſt, with Caution that he ſhould croſs the Seas that Day, or the next, that he might not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49492:102"/>be produced to Confront, if the matter ſhould come to Light to be queſtion'd. So the Lord Keeper and <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> parted with much ſhew of Love, each ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtain'd that which they met for. Some that will make us believe, that they are very ſcrupulous and Conſcientious, will ſnuff at ſomewhat related, as if it were not plain dealing; but it is as good; for it is harmleſs Policy; 'tis profitable and Pleaſant. <hi>Et iſta quidem ſine noxâ decipiunt: Quo modo praeſtigiatorum acetabula &amp; calculi; in quibus me fallacia ipſa delectat:</hi> They that do Feats with ſlight of hand, delude us, and pleaſe us with their cunning, <hi>ſays</hi> Seneca.

He ſaw no Sleep that Night with his Eyes, nor ſtirr'd out of the Room till about ſeven in the Morning he had trimm'd up a fair Copy of all the Proceedings, which he preſented to the Prince in St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and told him he had the Viper and her Brood in a Box.

                     <q>let your Highneſs be pleas'd to take my Petition along with you; <hi>Where is it</hi> ſays the Prince? 'In my Mouth</q> 
                     <hi>ſays He;</hi> 
                     <q>for I humbly beg, that you will conceal me in all that I have done in this Matter; and as you tender my Life, to keep the knowledge of my ſhare in this from your Father. <hi>Vetus Diſciplina re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum ſilentium vitae periculo ſanxerat,</hi> Curtius; is an Old Rule. I have committed two great Crimes in a Sworn Counſellor.</q>

                     <q>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſearch into the King's Counſels, which he would not ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd.</q>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince thought there could be no hurt in that, which was good for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet gave him aſſurance, he ſhould not be drawn out of the Tiring Houſe, to the open Stage. His <hi>Highneſs</hi> came very chearful to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and calling <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> aſide, reach'd him the Papers, with the counterfeit Brats in one Column, and the Apology in the other Column which daſht them againſt the Wall. The Writing was a Servants, whoſe hand was not known at Court. But the Duke lik'd the whole Bulk extreamly, and moſt humbly thank'd the Prince, that his Caſe was enwoven with his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and their double Vindication put into one Frame. And beſought to know what <hi>Vitruvius</hi> had compacted a Piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture; of ſuch concinnity, in ſo ſhort a time; but could not obtein it. The Prince and Duke made no longer preparation, but forthwith deſir'd a private hearing with the King, and with a modeſt and comfortable confidence gave up the Schedule to his Majeſty's moſt Excellent Conſideration. He Read all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, and at many ſtops ſaid <hi>'twas well, very well,</hi> and an enlivening Spirit Danced in his Eye. Then he drew his Son and <hi>Buckingham</hi> near to him, and Embraced them, proteſting that it ſorrowed him much, that he had aggrieved them with a Jealouſie ſomented by no better then Traytors. Aſſur'd them the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations were diſpers'd, and their Innocency ſhin'd as Bright as at Noon Day. <hi>And that you may know,</hi> ſays his Majeſty, <hi>How little you ſhall pay me for Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ask no more but to tell me, who is your Ingeneer, that ſtruck theſe Sparks out of the Flint, and lighted the Candle to find the Groat that was loſt.</hi> The Prince ſtood Mute: The Duke avowed he knew not the Author. <hi>Well</hi> ſays the King, <hi>I have a good Noſtril, and will Anſwer mine own Queſtion, my Keeper had the main Finger in it, I dare Swear it was he that bolted the Flower, and made it up into this Paiſt.</hi> 
                     <q>Sir</q> 
                     <hi>ſays the Prince,</hi> 
                     <q>I was precluded by my Promiſe not to Reveal him, but I never promis'd to tell a Lye for him.</q> Your Majeſty hath hit the Man. <hi>And God do him good for it,</hi> ſays the King. <hi>I need not tell you both what you owe him for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and he hath done himſelf this Right with me, that I diſcern his ſufficiency more
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49492:103"/>and more.</hi> All this the Prince Related at his next Meeting to the Lord Keeper. This paſſage ſo memorable hath pluck'd on a Prolix Narration for divers Reaſons. It was a ſecret manag'd between few perſons, (though the greateſt) and likely to be buried for ever, unleſs it riſe from the Duſt, where it was ſmother'd, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion. It will expound to inquiſitive Men; why, after this time, the old King never retrieved the Spaniſh Match, as if ſuddenly it were ſunk, and ſet beneath the Horizon of his Thoughts; it demonſtrates, why in a year after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Firſt of King <hi>Charles,</hi> there was ſuch Willingneſs in the young King, and ſuch Readineſs in the Duke, to Rigg a great Navy, and to ſend it with Defiance of Hoſtility to <hi>Cales;</hi> for though the Grandee <hi>Inoioſa</hi> received a ſharp Rebuke here, to vex his Gorge, and ſuddenly pack'd up his portable Gods, and went to his own Country in a Fume, yet he received no Diſfavour or Frown upon it from the Court of <hi>Spain. Nihil nefas eſt malitiae.</hi> It tells you what a Stone of Offence was laid before the King, able to make him to Diſſolve the Parliament, juſt upon the Expectation of a happy Winding up, if the Lord Keeper had not removed the Jealouſie away, which is one of the beſt Offices of a Chriſtian; for it is God's own Attribute in the Prophets, to be a Repairer of Breaches. Laſtly, His Wit was in Conjunction with the Safety of his great Friend the Duke, <hi>Et vincente Odenato, triumphavit Gallienus,</hi> ſays <hi>Pollio:</hi> The Keeper had Content enough, that the Duke triumphed over thoſe Foes, whom he had vanquiſhed for him.</p>
                  <p n="206">206. Soon as thoſe Hobgoblins, which haunted the King to fright him, were frighted away themſelves, and the Magicians which conjured them up, were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered odious, his Majeſty was never in a better Mood to pleaſe his Subjects, and the Subjects in Parliament, never, from that day to this, in ſo dutiful a Frame to pleaſe their Soveraign. <hi>Fatebimur regem talibus miniſtris, &amp; illos tanto rege fuiſſe dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſimos. Curt. l.</hi> 4. As <hi>Alexander</hi> deſerved ſuch brave Commanders under him; ſo they deſerved to be commanded by ſo brave a Prince as <hi>Alexander.</hi> Their long Counſels, which had been weather bound, came to a quiet Road, and their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was <hi>lighted of thoſe</hi> Statutes, which are of immortal Memory. The wiſe Men of thoſe times ask'd for good Laws with Moderation (for Moderation had not yet out-liv'd the Peoples Palate) and they were brought forth with Joy and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And that which was gotten with Peace and Joy, will out-laſt that, were it ten times more, which is extorted in a Hurly-burly. There were no Rents, no Diviſions among the Members, much leſs did the Stronger Part ſpurn out the Weaker. The Voices went all one way, as a Field of Wheat is bended, that's blown with a gentle Gale, <hi>One and all.</hi> And God did not let a general Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence paſs without a general Bleſſing. <hi>Sic viritim laboraverunt, quaſi ſumma res ſingulorum manibus teneretur. Nazar. Paneg.</hi> The Laws deviſed were confirmed in Cluſters by the Royal Authority. And though one of them, about the ſtrict Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> was then ſtop'd, the Name of <hi>Sabbath</hi> being unſatisfactory to the King's Mind, yet Amends were made, that the Kingdom had a <hi>Sabbath</hi> granted it from many Suits and Unquietneſſes. That which Crowned all, was the Pardon, the moſt general that ever was granted, which was the ſooner got, becauſe the Pillars of the Common-wealth had diſcharged their publick Truſt without Offence. The next Seſſion of this Parliament was appointed in <hi>April</hi> following; and this Seſſion ſhut up with the End of <hi>June.</hi> The Lord Keeper was not a little joy'd with the ſweet Cloſe of it; for which he had gained a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Report.

As <hi>Tully</hi> praiſed <hi>Octavius Ceſar, Ex quo judicari poteſt virtutis eſſe quàm aetatis curſum celeriorem, Philip</hi> 8. In eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Virtue runs on ſwifter than Age. And it is a Slander (whereof late Writers are very rank in all Kinds) which one hath publiſh'd, that this Man's Succeſſor, the Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> reverſed many of his Decrees, and corrected his Errors. I do not blame Lawyers, if they would have us believe, that none is fit for the Office of Chancellor, but one of their own Profeſſion. But let them plead their own Learning, and able Parts, without traducing the Gifts of them, that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeen in Theological Caſes of Conſcience, and ſingularly rare in natural So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lertiouſneſs. Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> was a renowned Magiſtrate, and his Honour was the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49492:103"/>Honour of the Times, wherein he liv'd, the vaſt Compaſs of that Knowledge wherein he was always bred, and his ſtrong Judgment in ſearching into thoſe Cauſes, did tranſcend his Predeceſſor; yet not to obſcure him, as if he were wanting in that, which was required to his Place. A good Carpenter knows how to frame a Houſe, as well as the Geometer that ſurveyed the Eſcurial. Let me quote a couple of Witneſſes, what they aſſerted herein, and they are rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as God, the great Witneſs of all things, knows. The Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in the beginning of the next Term, at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> perſwaded the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hobart,</hi> either to deliver it to the King with his own Mouth, or to ſet it under his Hand, that Lord <hi>Williams</hi> was not ſit for the Keeper's Place, becauſe of his Inabilities and Ignorance; and that he would undertake thereupon, to caſt the Complained out, and himſelf ſhould ſucceed him. <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſays Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Hobart, ſomewhat might have been ſaid at the firſt; but he ſhould do the Lord Keeper great Wrong that ſaid ſo now.</hi> After this Grave and Learned Lord, I bring forth Mr. <hi>G Evelin,</hi> one of the Six Clerks, and, in his time, the beſt Head-piece of the Office, who delighted to divulge it, as many yet living know, that Lord Keeper <hi>Williams</hi> had the moſt towring, ſublime Wit that he ever heard ſpeak; magnified his Decrees, as hitting the White in all Cauſes, and never miſſing. That Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> did ſeldom after any thing he had ſetled before him, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on new Preſumptions, and ſpake of him always in Court with due Praiſe, and Juſtification of his Tranſactions. He that hath inſinuated the contrary, aiming to do Honour to none, but to the Students of the Laws, hath run out of the Ring. And is it not honeſter to ſay nothing, than to go about to do good with a Miſchief?</p>
                  <p n="207">207. And that Man might ſee better to do Juſtice, who would never <hi>receive a Bribe to blind his Eyes,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.3. This was known, not only to me a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick, but to all that walked the Streets; who were informed, what Repulſes they had, who tempted him with Gratifications. This I am ſure of, as I know what is ſweet by mine own Taſt, and by the common Opinion. One thing I will remember, not becauſe it is of great Moment, but becauſe it is pleaſant. His Lordſhip being retired to <hi>Nonſuch</hi> in the Summer, took the Air in the great Park; and viewing from one of the Hills, the little Village of <hi>Malden,</hi> he eſpied a Church new built, and asked at whoſe Charge it was done. Mr. <hi>George Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> that attended him, told him who was the greateſt Benefactor. <hi>And hath he not a Suit now depending in</hi> Chancery? ſays the Keeper. <hi>The very ſame,</hi> ſays the other. <hi>And the very ſame,</hi> ſays the Keeper, <hi>ſhall not fare the worſe for building of Churches.</hi> Which being related by Mr. <hi>Minors</hi> to his Neighbour, the Gentleman the next Morning ſent a Taſt of the Fruits of his Orchard, and of the Poultry in his Yard, to <hi>Nonſuch-Houſe. Nay, carry them back</hi> George, ſays the Keeper, <hi>and tell your Friend, he ſhall not fare the better for ſending of Preſents.</hi> If any were ſo uncharitably ſuſpitious, that this Lord ſold Juſtice for Gold or Silver, though not for meaner things, and gathered where he ſhould not, there could be no Ground to ſurmiſe it; but becauſe he ſcattered much. For he was magnificent in great Works, profuſe in Hoſpitality, very expenſive in Liberality to poor Scholars, and decay'd Perſons. To maintain all this, he had plenty coming in, which wanted not the Art of good Husbandry to lay it out. He was as Provident, as he was Bountiful. He never feaſted the King, and very rarely exhauſted himſelf upon Courtiers in laviſh Entertainments. But according to the honeſt, and thrifty Rule of <hi>Caſſiodor, Fundit potiùs qui mittit in plenum: &amp; illud reconditur, quod vaſis va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuis congregatur.</hi> He ſpread not out his Compoſt upon rich Soil, but upon hungry Land. He gave ſo faſt to Scholars, that it was not poſſible his Leſt-hand ſhould know what his Right-hand did. <hi>Quod momentum aut beneficio ſterile? Aut vacuum laude? Plin. Paneg.</hi> If they were young, he did it to encourage them; if aged, to reward them. And Gentlemen that were brought low, not by their Vices, but by Misfortune, <hi>Poveri vergogneſi,</hi> as the <hi>Tuſcan</hi> calls them, Baſhful, and could not Crave, though they periſhed, he prevented their Modeſty, and would hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thank thoſe that diſcovered their commiſerable Condition to him. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the <hi>Gate-Houſe</hi> found the way to their Neighbour's Purſe every Week. It were endleſs to take notice of his good Works, but in great Conſtellations. <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giunt ſine nomine ſigna, Manil. lib.</hi> 1. Stars, that appear Small and dim, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver numbred. And though he was better at Liberality than Patience; yet when he had overgone three years in the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> he watched his Paſſions ſo well, that the Heat of his old Brittiſh Complexion was much abated, and carried all things with far more Lenity, than Choler: Would chide little, and bear
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49492:104"/>much. Vehement he was often to recall Pleaders to the Point, and to preſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Diſpatch. Vehemency is miſtaken, if it be called Anger: As <hi>Cicero</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himſelf to <hi>Fuſius Calenus, Vehementer me agere fatcor, iracundè nego. Philip</hi> 8. But if his Paſſion break out too far beyond the Meaſure of Vehemency, he never reſted till he had made ſome Amends to him, whom he had ſadded or offended. which is the Apology that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> makes for the good Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Elder in his Funeral Rites. <hi>Tunc proprior fuiſſet veniae, cum fuiſſet commotio major iracundiae—Optabatur in eo, quod in aliis timebatur, ut iraſceretur.</hi> So the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents at the Bar had ſtudied the good Nature of this Lord, and preſaged, that after he had chaſed at their Miſ-uſance, they might promiſe to themſelves a good Caſt of his Office long before the Sun ſet, which never ſet before he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Patience and loving Kindneſs.</p>
                  <p n="208">208. Difficulties in Parliament, Labours in Chancery were well paſs'd over; but to keep in long with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was inſuperable; unleſs the Lord Keeper would be ſtupid, and oppoſe him in nothing, though the Dukes, as well as his Ruine were upon Contrivance, and the notorious Hurt of them, that were better than them both. Since his Grace's Return from <hi>Spain,</hi> you ſhall find the Keeper in every of his Letters in the <hi>Cabal,</hi> few excepted, endeavouring to take off the Edge of ſome late ſtarted Quarrel. As <hi>P.</hi> 96. in a Date <hi>July</hi> 21, 1624, in this Submiſſion. <hi>If ever I have offended your Grace, I take Almighty God to witneſs, it was for want of a perfect Underſtanding of thoſe high Matters</hi> (let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be informed it was about the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s Recriminations) <hi>not out of any Corruption of Affections towards your Grace, or the leaſt ſtruggling in a continued Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to live and dye your Grace's moſt conſtant, and moſt faithful Servant.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would ſucceed to good Liking or no, he was reſolved to divert him from ſome deſperate Courſes, into which his Grace was entring, to raiſe vaſt Summs of Money, the Nerves of a ſudden War with <hi>Spain,</hi> which he meant to begin, as ſoon as he could be furniſhed with Coin. The Keeper was very ſick of a Fevor and a Flux at this time; and, after Danger of Life, recovered by that great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of Nature, Dr. <hi>William Harvey,</hi> being not able to go into the Air, he writes to my Lord Duke, what he conceived about his former Project, <hi>Octob.</hi> 21.</p>

There is no Script of it remaining in the <hi>Cabal,</hi> nor in any other Pamphlet, that I have read. It was a Miſchief not better prevented, than concealed from the World that it was prevented. But the Relation of the Lord Keeper to him that heard it of him, when it was freſh and in motion, hath been preſerved in the Desk, and comes forth now to publick Knowledge. <hi>Rem tibi auctorem dabo,</hi> as <hi>Plautus</hi> ſays; whereby the Men of theſe times may ſee, how the Sale of Church-Lands was plotted, before they were ſwept away with an Ordinance, and that Earneſt was offered for them long ago. Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, entred far into ſuch a Propoſition, a ſhrewd wiſe Man, a very Learned, and of eſteemed Piety; but zealous for a new Diſcipline, and given to Change. When I ſee good Parts not always well uſed; or a worthy Scholar not well affected to the Church, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat him in Chriſt, and nurſed him up, I cannot but remember a Tale in <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Ann.</hi> 513. <hi>com.</hi> 27. thoug I care not for believing it. That <hi>Theodorus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> was much in love with the ſtrict Life and Piety of a Monk, a Syrian by Nation, that cared not for the Communion of the Church; at which <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was ſcandalized, that ſo vertuous a Man ſhould incline to be a Schiſmatick, till God ſatisfied him in a Viſion, for, ſays he, <hi>Vidi columbam ſuper caput ejus ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem fuliginoſam &amp; ſqualidam;</hi> he ſaw the Holy Ghoſt come upon him, but in the Shape of a ruſty ſooty coloured Dove. But before the Artifice of Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> be diſplay'd, Judgment muſt paſs how the great Duke was prepared to be wrought upon. When all men talkt jocundly upon the next Seſſion of Parliament, appointed for <hi>April,</hi> they that were watchful for the Duke's Safety, ſaw Cauſe to fear, leaſt the Predeſtination of that Seſſion might turn to be his Grace's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. The King his Maſter was too Politick to ſeem weary of him, now become the moſt affected of his Son; but half an Eye might diſcern he was not fond of him. The Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who had ſeen much Abroad, and knew much at Home, was charged, in his Abſence, from his Mouth, with great Errors, that he had deluded the King with Hopes of a Marriage from <hi>Spain,</hi> never intended; and with Crimes, that he had, if not Counſelled the Prince to alter his Religion, yet to temporize, as if he held it in a ſlip Knot, and could paſs it eaſily from him, if his Highneſs might win the Garland he came for. The Earl, in his Replicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on defied the Duke, and vowed to charge upon his Head, that in his Expedition to <hi>Spain,</hi> he had done the worſt Service, and the higheſt Wrongs, that a Subject could do to a Soveraign. His Majeſty umpir'd between both with that fatal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, that he would hear <hi>Buckingham</hi> againſt <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol</hi> againſt <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> before the two houſes in due time. And his manner of Juſtice was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, that he would ſhelter no man againſt the General, and Concluded Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Parliament. <hi>Antoninus</hi> was a wiſe Emperor, that never ſtood out againſt the Common Vote of the Senate, and never varied from that Saying, ſays <hi>Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus, Aequum eſt ut ego tot ac talium amicorum conſilium ſequar, quàm ut tot &amp; tales amici mei unius voluntatem ſequantur.</hi> And if the King ſhould ſhrink from him, the Peers and Commons were like to receive him unkindly. His Greatneſs, though it wained with the Father, it increaſed with the Son, and was like to flouriſh ever by this latter Spring; but the more it grew, the worſe it was lik'd. He was the Top-ſail of the Nobility, and in Power and Truſt of Offices far above all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Whither the Lords maligned this, becauſe they did not ſhare, or whither they conceived it dangerous to the State, their own Hearts knew beſt. One thing is ſure, that many of them did not palliate their Diſ-reliſh, but girded at it upon all Occaſions. It was come to paſs, that he only turned the Key to all that were
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49492:105"/>let in to the King or Prince: And his multiformous Places compell'd ſuch a ſwarm of Suitors to hum about him, that the Train, that continually jogged after him, look'd like the Stream of a Blazing Star, fatal and ominous. Therefore it was ſtudied by the wiſeſt of thoſe, that were upheld by his Grace, and reſorted moſt unto him, that either his Lordſhip muſt hope in a War, and that ſpeedily, and be fluſh of Money, to be prodigal among the Commanders: Or if he came to be tried in the Furnace of the next Seſſion of Parliament, he had need to make the Refiners to be his Friends.</p>
                  <p n="210">210. Here ſteps in Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> a good Crow to ſmell Carion; and brought Conditions with him, to make his Grace malleable upon the great Anvil, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver break. This Politick Man, that he might feel the Pulſe of the Court, had preferr'd himſelf to be Chaplain to the Prince, and wanted not the Intelligence of all dark Myſteries, through the Scotch eſpecially of his Highneſs's Bedchamber. Theſe gave him countenance more than others, becauſe he proſecuted the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of their Countrymen <hi>Knox.</hi> To the Duke he repairs. And be aſſured he had more Skill, than boiſterouſly to propound to him the Extirpation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, remembring what King <hi>James</hi> had ſaid in the Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court, Anno</hi> 1. <hi>No Biſhop, No King.</hi> Therefore he began to dig further off, and to heave at the Diſſolution of Cathedral Churches, with their Deans and Chapters, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary from whence the ableſt Scholars were removed to Biſhopricks. At his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with the Duke he told him, He was ſorry his Grace's Actions were not ſo well interpreted abroad, as Godly Men thought they deſerved. That ſuch Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, as were but Vapours in common Talk, might prove to be Tempeſts when a Parliament met. That his ſafeſt way was to Anchor himſelf upon the Love of the People. And let him perſwade himſelf, he ſhould not ſail to be Maſter of that Atchievement, if he would profeſs himſelf, not among thoſe that are Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants at large, and never look inward to the Center of Religion, but become a warm and zealous Chriſtian, that would employ his beſt help ſtrenuouſly to lop off from this half-reformed Church, the ſuperfluous Branches of Romiſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that much disfigured it. Then he named the Quire-Service of Cathedral and Collegiate Churches, with the Appennages, which were maintained with vaſt Wealth, and Lands of exceſſive Commodity, to feed fat, lazy, and unprofitable Drones. And yet all that Chanting and Pomp hindred the Heavenly Power, and Simplicity of Prayer: And furthered not the Preaching of the Goſpel. And now, ſays he, let your Grace obſerve all the enſuing Emoluments, if you will lean to this Counſel, God's Glory ſhall be better ſet forth, (that's ever the Quail-Pipe to bring Worldings into the Snares of Sacrilege:) The Lands of thoſe Chapters eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheating to the Crown, by the Diſſolution of their Foundations, will pay the King's Debts. Your Grace hath many Alliances of Kindred, all ſucking from you, and the Milk of thoſe Breaſts will ſerve them all, and nouriſh them up to great Growth with the beſt Seats in the Nation. Laſtly, Your Grace ſhall not only ſurmount Envy, but turn the Darling of the Commonwealth, and be reverenced by the beſt Operators in Parliament, as a Father of a Family. And if a Crum ſtick in the Throat of any conſiderable Man, that attempts to make a contrary part, it will be eaſie to waſh it down with Mannors, Woods, Royalties, Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the large Provent of thoſe Superſtitious Plantations.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the Doctor, and to theſe Heads, as the Duke in a good Mind reveal'd it. The moſt crafty, and clawing Piece of all was, That the Deſtruction of theſe Sacred Foundations would make a Booty for a Number of Gentlemen: And as the Greeks ſay proverbially, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, When a great Oak falls, every Neighbour may ſcuffle for a Faggot. You may be ſure the Duke ſent this Doctor away with great Thanks, and bad him watch the beſt times of leiſure, and come to him often, who did not loſe the Privilege of that Liberty, but thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Bedchamber at leaſt thrice a Week with a ſly Audacity. The Lord Keeper heard of it, and wondred what occaſion'd their private, and frequent Meetings; Nor could he knock off the Bar of the Secret with his Golden Hammer, till it was revealed to him by ſome of the neareſt about his Majeſty. For the Duke had caſt forth the Project in a dark imperfect Form before the King; and the King, muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling his true Face that it could not be ſeen, heard him with a diſſembled Patience, becauſe he was pleas'd to have him nibble upon this Bait, that he might divert the Yonker as long as he could from forcing him to undertake a War, which was a violent Cauſtick that ſeared up the Comfort of his Majeſties Heart. All this was conveyed to the Lord Keeper, and being feeble, and ſcarce upon his Legs again, it wrought upon his ſick Spirits with great Anxiety. He was ſure his Majeſty had
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49492:105"/>no Stomach to devour ſuch an unſanctified Morſel: Yet againſt that aſſurance he objected to himſelf, That the Duke was wont to overturn all Obſtacles that ſtood in his way: And that the Imperial Eagle of Neceſſity would ſtoop to any Prey. Then he took Chear again, that he had never Noted in the Lord Duke a Diſpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency againſt the Proſperity of the Church: Again, his Comfort was rebated, that Self-Preſervation will make a Saint a Libertine, and that Nice Points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are not uſually admitted to give Law againſt it. Howſoever, he reſolv'd to hazard all to cruſh this Cockatrice in the Egg. <hi>Cauſa jubet ſuperes m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="211">211. At the firſt Onſet he had ſmall Encouragement: For he came to <hi>Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-Houſe</hi> to break with the Duke upon this matter, who was then ſhut up with Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> in cloſe Conſultation, where the Great Seal, and the Keeper of it, waited two Hours in the Anti-Camera, and was ſent Home without the Civility of Admiſſion. Next Day he got Speech with Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> by Friends employ'd to bring him to <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> And after much <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> in their Diſcourſe, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the want of Preſerment had diſguſted the Doctor, he offer'd to him, if he would buſie himſelf no more in contriving the Ruine of the Church, that he would the next Day reſign the Deanery of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to him. But the wily Doctor did not believe him: For he came to cheat, and not to be cheated: So they parted unkindly. The Lord Keeper ſaw now that this Nail was driven in far: Yet he did not deſpair to pluck it out with his Wit: And thus he went into the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He obtain'd an Opportune Conference with the Duke, and in the Defence of the Church he could never be taken unprovided. He pray'd his Grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That no Man wiſh'd his Safety more cordially than himſelf, by whoſe Hand he was lifted up to that Place of Pre-eminence wherein he ſate. Therefore it was his Duty to admoniſh him timely, that he was building that Safety upon hollow Ground. He had ſpoken with <hi>Preſton,</hi> who had offer'd his Grace flitten Milk, out of which he ſhould churn nothing. There were other ways to level Envy, than by offending God: And if he meant to gather Moneys for War, let him Wage it with the Prayers of the Clergy, and not with their Curſes. That Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of male-contents, to whoſe Love an Evil Counſellor woed him, was ever falſe and untruſty; not ſuſpected, but known, ever ſince the Faction was firſt rock'd in the Cradle, to be tied by no Benefits: Importunate Suitors, and ever craving: And having ſped, think their Cauſe, and their Deſervings have paid Thanks ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to their Patron. And look what Colours the King our Maſter hath laid upon them, (and they are in Oyl, which will not be got out) in his Inſtructions to his Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> where, upon bitter Experience, he tells him, That <hi>he was more faithfully ſerved by the Highlanders. Then what a Merchant have you got of this ſpiteful Miniſter, who would have you to commit your Stock to their Managing, who would bring you Hatred for Love, and Infamy for Honour? But if your Grace conceive that I am hitherto rather upon the Invective than the Proof, I will ſtep into another Point, and clear it againſt all Contradiction, That if your Grace appear in diſtracting the Church-Lands from their holy and rightful uſe, your Endeavours ſhall be cried down in Parliament, not to terrifie you, that your Adverſaries will increaſe, and batter you with this great Shot, that you attempted to diſſolve the Settlement of Church and Laws. You loſe your ſelf,</hi> ſays the Duke, <hi>in Generalities: Make it out to me in particular if you can, with all your Cunning, what ſhould lead you to ſay, That the Motion you pick at ſhould find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe and baffle in the Houſe of Commons. I know not how you Biſhops may ſtruggle, but I am much deluded if a great part of the Knights and Burgeſſes would not be glad to ſee this Alteration.</hi> The Lord Keeper had a Liſt of their Names in readineſs, a Scrowle which he always carried about with him, which he pluck'd out, and pray'd his Grace he might give him a Cypher of the Inclinations, either of the moſt, or of the Bell-weathers. And having entred a little into that tedious Work, the Duke ſnatch'd the Scrowle out of his Hand, and running it over with his Eye, ſaid no more but, <hi>I find abundance of Lawyers among them. Yes, Sir,</hi> ſays the Keeper, <hi>most of them Men of Learning, and Renown in their Profeſſion. I think by my continual Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating with them, I know their Addictions in Religion, whether they ſtand right, or which way they bend. I will not prejudge the Speaker, and one or two more, God knows their Hearts. But for the reſt, I know they will be ſtrong for the ſupportance of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Chapters. Is it ſo,</hi> ſaid his Grace? <hi>And what do you think of Sir</hi> Edward Coke? <hi>Marry,</hi> ſays the Keeper, <hi>no Friend to an old Friend. In the 39 of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>when he was Atturney-General, he Damm'd a Patent, ſurreptitiouſly gotten before his time by thoſe Lime-Hounds employ'd for Concealments, by which they went far to ſwallow up the greateſt part of the Demeaſns of the Biſhop of</hi> Norwich, <hi>revived the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49492:106"/>Right of thoſe Religious Poſſeſſions by his own Induſtry and Proſecution, and for the most part at his own Charge; and reſted not, till for more Security, after the Patent was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, he had confirm'd thoſe Lands to the Biſhop by an Act of Parliament. Therefore I would we had no worſe Strings to our Bow than Sir</hi> Edward Coke. <hi>But whom doth your Grace name next. Nay,</hi> ſays the Duke, <hi>you are come to me, my Lord, in a lucky Hour. I was never further than in an Equipoiſe about this Project; Now I have done with it. 'Tis ſtill-born, and let it be interr'd without Chriſtian Burial. My Good Lord,</hi> ſays the Lord Keeper, <hi>I thank God for it: And I would all the Kingdom knew as well as I do, how ſoon your good Nature is brought to a right Underſtanding.</hi>

If Threatings had been mortal Shot, he had Periſht; for he never had ſuch a Chiding before: but he kept his Ground, becauſe he held the fairer ſide of the Quarrel. Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> the Dean of <hi>York,</hi> was lately Dead, and much Deplor'd: For he was an Ornament to the Church. My Lord Duke, entreated by great ones, named a Succeſſor, that had no Seaſoning or Taſt of Matter in him, one Dr. <hi>Scot:</hi> But a Doctor, <hi>Inter Doctores Bullatos,</hi> for he never ſtood in
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49492:106"/>the Commencement to approve himſelf; beſide too many Faults to be ript up. I have known a Scholar in <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſo bad a Rider, that no Man for Love or Price would furniſh him with a Horſe. I would have thought no Man would have furniſht ſuch a Scholar as this with a Deanery, chiefly of <hi>York.</hi> It came about ſtrangely. <hi>Scot</hi> was a Prodigal Gamſter, and had loſt upon the Ticket to a Noble Perſon far more then he was worth. Which Debt his Creditor knew not how to recover, but by Thruſting him, aided with my Lord Dukes Power, into this Rich Preferment. The Caſuiſts among all the Species of Simony never Dream'd of this, which may be called, <hi>Simonia Aleatoria,</hi> when a Gameſter is Inſtalled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a goodly Dignity, to make him capable to pay the Scores of that which he had loſt with a bad Hand: And yet the Man Died in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and was not Solvent. The Lord Keeper intending to put of Dr. <hi>Scot</hi> from this place, beſought for the remove of thoſe moſt worthy Divines, Dr. <hi>White,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> or to Collate it upon Dr. <hi>Warner,</hi> the moſt Charitable, and very Prudent Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter.</hi> But he was ſo terrified for giving this good Counſel, that he writes, now he knew his Graces Reſolution he would alter his Opinion, and would be careful in giving the leaſt Cauſe of Jealouſie in that kind again. Yet it is a received Maxime, <hi>Defuturos eos qui ſuaderent, ſi ſuaſiſſe ſit periculum,</hi> Curt. l. 3. Certainly with others this might work to his Eſteem, but nothing to his Prejudice. And I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently avouch, what I knowingly ſpeak, (that I may uſe the Words of my indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Friend, Mr. <hi>T. F.</hi> in his Church Hiſtory) <q>That the Solicitation for Dr. <hi>Theodore Price,</hi> about Two Months after, was not the firſt motive of a Breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Keeper and the Duke, (the day-light clears that without dusky con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures) no, nor any Proceſs to more unkindneſs then was before, which was indeed grown too high.</q> The Caſe is quickly Unfolded. Dr. <hi>Price</hi> was Country. Man, Kinſman, and great Acquaintance of the Lord Keepers. By whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement he was ſent a Commiſſioner into <hi>Ireland</hi> two years before, with Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> Sir <hi>T. Crew,</hi> Sir <hi>James Perrot,</hi> and others, to rectifie Grievances in Church and Civil State that were complain'd. In Executing which Commiſſion he came of with Praiſe, and with Encouragement from His Majeſty, that he ſhould not fail of Recompence for his Well-doing. Much about the time that the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd out of <hi>Spain</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Aſaph</hi> ſoll void; the County of <hi>Merioneth,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Price</hi> was Born, being in the Dioceſs. The Lord Keeper attempted to get that Biſhoprick for Dr. <hi>Price.</hi> But the Prince, ſince the time that by his Patent he was ſtyled Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> had Claimed the Biſhopricks of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality for his own Chaplains: So Dr. <hi>Melburn,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Carlton,</hi> were preferr'd to <hi>St. Davids</hi> and <hi>Landaff.</hi> And <hi>Aſaph</hi> was now Conferr'd upon Dr. <hi>Hanmer</hi> his Highneſs's Chaplain, that well deſerv'd it. A little before King <hi>James</hi>'s Death, Dr. <hi>Hampton,</hi> Primate of <hi>Armach,</hi> as ſtout a Prelate, and as good a Governor as the See had ever enjoy'd, Died in a good old Age. Whereupon the Keeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed for Dr. <hi>Price</hi> to Succeed him. But the Eminent Learning of Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> (for who could match him all in all in <hi>Europe?</hi>) carried it from his Rival. Dr. <hi>Price</hi> was very Rational, and a Divine among thoſe of the firſt Note, according to the ſmall skill of my Perceivance: And his Hearers did teſtifie as much, that were preſent at his Latin Sermon, and his Lectures <hi>pro gradu</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> But becauſe he had never Preach'd ſo much as one Sermon before the King, and had left to do his calling in the Pulpit for many years, it would not be admitted that he ſhould Aſcend to the Primacy of <hi>Armach,</hi> no, nor ſo much as ſucceed Dr. <hi>Uſher</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Meth.</hi> To which Objection, his Kinſman, that ſtickled for his Preferment, could give no good Anſwer; and drew of with ſo much eaſe upon it, that the Reverend Dr. <hi>Uſher</hi> had no cauſe to Regret at the Lord Keeper for an Adverſary; Neither did Dr. <hi>Price</hi> ever ſhew him Love after that day; and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then, or ſooner, loſt the Doctors Heart.</p>
                  <p n="214">214. It is certain that all Grants at the Court went with the Current of my Lord Dukes Favour. None had Power to oppoſe it, nor the King the Will. For he Rul'd all his Majeſties Deſigns: I may not ſay his Affections: Yet the L. Keeper declin'd him ſometimes in the Diſpatches of his Office, upon great and juſt Cauſe. Whereupon the King would ſay in his pleaſant Manners, <hi>That he was a ſtout Man that durſt do more than himſelf.</hi> For ſince his Highneſs's return out of <hi>Spain,</hi> if any Offices were procur'd in State of Reverſion, or any Advouzons of Church Dignities, he interpos'd, and ſtopt the Patents, as Injurious to the Prince, to whoſe Donation they ought to belong in juſt time, and preſerv'd them for him, that all ſuch Rewards might come entire and undefloured to his Patronage. Wherein his Highneſs maintain'd his Stiffneſs; for that foreſight did procure, that

He had receiv'd the Gift of our Service Book, and to requite the Doner, having much of a Scholar, and of ingenuous Breeding, he laid aſide all other buſineſs to read it over.

It was well thought of by him, that the Tryal of the ſoundneſs in Religion conſiſts not all together in the Draught of a Book, but in the motion likewiſe, and Exerciſe of it. The Abbat made his mind known to the Lord Keeper by Sir <hi>George Goring</hi> (now Earl of <hi>Norwich</hi>) that he would gladly be preſent in the Abby of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> upon our Chriſtmaſs Day in the morning, to behold and hear how that great Feaſt was ſolemnized in our Congregations, which heard very ill beyond the Seas for Profaneneſs: Whereas the Book for Uniformity of Publick Prayer, which he

Therefore he made ſuit to be placed, where none could perceive him, and that an Interpreter of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy might aſſiſt him, to turn the Book, and to make right Anſwers to ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, as fell by the way into his Animadverſions. None more forward then the Lord Keper to meet the Abbat in this Requeſt. <hi>Veritas oculatos teſtes non refermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi> The Abbat kept his hour to come to Church upon that High Feaſt, and a Place was well fancied aloft, with a Latice and Curtains to conceal him.

He ſung the Service, Preach'd the Sermon, Conſecrated the Lords Table; and being aſſiſted with ſome of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries, diſtributed the Elements of the Holy Communion to a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, meekly kneeling upon their knees. Four hours and better, were ſpent that morning before the Congregation was diſmiſs'd with the Epiſcopal Bleſſing. The Abbat was entreated to be a Gueſt at the Dinner, provided in the College-Hall, where all the Members of that Incorporation Feaſted together, even to the Elee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſynaries, call'd the Beads-men of the Foundation; no diſtinction being made, but high and low Eating their Meat with gladneſs together, upon the occaſion of our Saviours Nativity, that it might not be forgotten, that the poor Shepherds were admitted to Worſhip the Babe in the Manger, as well as the Potentates of the Eaſt, who brought Rich Preſents to offer up at the ſhrine of his Cradle. All having had their comfort both in Spiritual and Bodily Repaſt, the Maſter of the Feaſt, and the Abbat, with ſome few beſide, retired into a Gallery. The good Abbat preſently ſhew'd that he was Bred up in the <hi>Franco-Gallican</hi> Liberty of Speech, and without further Proem, defies the Engliſh that were Roaſted in the Abbies of <hi>France</hi> for lying Varlets, above all others that ever he met. <hi>We have none of their good word, I am ſure,</hi> ſays the Keeper; <hi>but what is it that doth empaſſion you for the preſent againſt them?</hi>

They traduc'd your Pulpits, as if they were not poſſeſt by Men that be Ordein'd by impoſition of Hands, but that Shop-keepers, and the Scum of the people Uſurp that Place in courſe one after another, as they preſum'd themſelves to be Gifted. Above all they turn'd their Reproaches againſt your behaviour at the Sacrament, deſcribing it as a prodigious Monſter of Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: That your Tables being furniſh'd with Meats and Drinks, you took the Scraps and Rellicks of your Bread and Cups, and call upon one another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus.

And where they have no means to maintain Gods Worſhip with coſtly Charge, and where they want the Authority of a Biſhop among them, the people will arrogate the greateſt ſhare in Government; ſo that in many things you muſt excuſe them, becauſe the Hand of conſtraint is upon them.</hi>

The King was now at <hi>White-Hall;</hi> and the French Agents plied it to concord Conditions for the Royal Marriage.

The Secretary <hi>Villoclare</hi> was accounted, and not miſtaken to be a ſervent Zealot in his own Religion; which our Engliſh had learnt, by reſorting daily to Maſs in the Embaſſadors Houſe. Theſe found Acceſs unto him and ſighed out their Grievances before him, that their Prieſts, who adventur'd to come to them for their Souls Health, were Executed for Traytors; and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſet ſuch Fines for their Conſcience, that they were utterly impoveriſh'd. How happy ſhould that Honourable Perſon be, that would skreen them from the ſcorching of this Perſecution? That his Lordſhip had Opportunity for his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and his Piety could not want will, to enter into a Motion for a relaxation of their Miſeries, among ſuch Articles as were to be Granted for the Honour, and Happineſs of the approaching Nuptials.

And he ſell to his work in good earneſt, and ask'd ſuch large conceſſions for his Clients, (or rather challeng'd ſuch Grace with horrid Liberty, then Petition'd for it) that the King was obſerv'd to begin to be cooler in the Treaty for the Marriage, then he had been.

And I fear they were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into too much confidence; for I have heard it often from the Followers of the Earl of <hi>Carlile,</hi> that after Articles had been drawn, and Engroſs'd, ſome things were Erazed, ſome things Interlaced, which never had his Lordſhips Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Our Courtiers at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> through whoſe Counſels and Reſolves the Grants of Monſieur <hi>Villoclare</hi> were to paſs, though directly they did dot yield to him, yet, his driving was ſo furious, that they declin'd to deny him, and ſhift for themſelves that the firſt Storm of his Paſſion might not fall upon them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they told him, they could not aſſure him he had prevail'd, till he had ſpoke with the Lord Keeper, whoſe Duty it was to Examine ſuch things, upon his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, what were ſit, or not ſit for the King's Conſcience, Honour, and Safety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Great Seal were put to.

He was not to learn, that a Magiſtrate in his Place muſt have a ſtrong back to bear the Burthen of Envy. So he Collected his thoughts into rational preparations, and was provided for a Bickering; which began on the Eighth of <hi>January,</hi> and held long.

And told his Majeſty, <q>That Counſellor had given him ſmall content in a long Argument vext between them; for he had Preach'd to him till he was weary to hear his Divinity, tho' it was Learned, and of more Acuteneſs then he expected in that Cauſe, but unſatisfactory to Catholicks, as could be fram'd: Yet he made him amends with ſuch Counſel in the end, that now he knew upon what Ground he ſtood; what Laws and Statutes were in force againſt that model of Mercy, which he had urg'd; and how the Clemency, and Power of his Majeſty was retrench'd by them. Therefore as he hoped to find his Majeſty Sweet and Gracious, ſo his Majeſty ſhould find him tractable, that the Thrice Noble and Primary deſign, about which he came, might not hover any longer in ſuſpence.</q>

In ſome things more, in ſome things leſs was ſpoken at firſt, but thus goes the Draught which the King received.</p>
                  <p>My Lord Embaſſador <hi>Villoclare</hi> gave me a Breviate of the Inſtrument of Grace, which he agitated to paſs in the Behalf of the Romiſh Recuſants.

The Storms lookt black over our Heads in thoſe times, when ſuch Statutes paſt, ſo offenſive to your Lordſhip, and were enacted not out of Revenge for Wrongs ſuſtained, but out of Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt againſt Harms to be prevented; not out of Spleen towards Adverſaries, but out of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our ſelves. So much, and without Pauſe or Faultring, I am compelled to ſay for our Laws, becauſe I am a principal Judge by the Favour of the King my Maſter, and ſworn to the Maintainance of the Law.</hi> This Anſwer, though neither tart nor umbragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet it ſet my Lord Ambaſſador's Teeth on edge, and he roſe up to theſe high Words at one pitch, <hi>That he could not imagine how our Laws could have been ſharpned with more Cruelty againſt the Catholicks: For it would look like Mercy to take away their Lives; or rather than to cut them ſo low with the Sickle of Penal Statutes, that they had ſcarce Stubble to maintain their Bodies, and their Souls were utterly ſtarved for want of Prieſts to inſtruct them; none of them daring to adventure to hold out Breaſts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Doctrine, to feed them with ſincere Milk; but that reſolved to be ript up, and quartered for their Holy Duty. Yet</hi> (he goes on) <hi>I bewail not ſo much thoſe Excellent Servants of God executed upon your Gibbets, they are recompenſed with the Crown of Martyrdom: But you murder the Souls of the Lay-Catholicks; and if you pity them not to the Good of their Salvation, all other pretended Favours light upon them like Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dews, which are not a fruitful, but a fatal Moiſture? You know my meaning Sir, you are Learned in Caſes of Divinity, and need not to be told that the Uſe and Fruition of the Sacraments are the vital Part of Chriſtian Religion in our Catholick Apprehenſion. Who ſhall celebrate them? Who ſhall impart them to this People robbed of Chriſt? Who ſhall ſatiate their Souls with thoſe Comforts, if the Prieſts, the Diſpenſers of thoſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, be utterly kept from them? You commonly ſay, you have done well for the Generality of Catholicks, that they have Liberty of Conſcience. I ſay your Gift is uſeleſs, if you permit them not Teachers that are ſet over their Conſcience. We are more clement to the Churches of</hi> Hugonots, <hi>and allow them their Miniſters. Without that Favour, a Ruſh for all the reſt. Should I ſend Cloth and Food enough to a Fraternity of Religious Men, What Good ſhall they reap from that Charity, if none ſhall be ſuffered to make them Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with that Cloth? None permitted to dreſs the Meat that is ſent them? Or let me ſpread before you your Unmerciful Dealing in this Similitude; you have not made a Law to pull out their Eyes, but you have paſt a Law that they ſhall have no Light to ſee by. My Lord, Why ſhould I make it a Labour to conteſt with you, to have no ſuch Statutes in Force? Methinks it is enough to prompt you, that ſuch Incongruities, of very bad Fame Abroad, ſhould be ſuperviſed and corrected upon ſo demulcing an Occaſion as this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age?</hi> Thus far my Lord Secretary: To whom I ſaid in this Manner.</p>

In Fifty Years after they were firſt ordained, they that have ſucceeded in Power and Authority, have not repented of them; but all, to whome the Care of the Kingdom's Welfare is committed, have continu'd them. Being nevertheleſs as pitiful as any, that have ſoft Hearts, and Chriſtian Principles. For though the Terror of the Laws is great, yet the Execution hath been gentle. Such as are convict of Recuſancy (who are no great Number in this Land) they alone pay Pecuniary Mulcts; but upon ſuch eaſie Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they have both the Cruſt and the Crumb of their Eſtates to themſelves, and the King hath ſcarce the Chippings.

I am willing to refer it to this Diſeaſe, which is common to moſt in corrupted Nature, that they that put on this Complaint, fill your Lordſhip's Ears with Whining that their Purſes are no fuller. If they ſay they are become indigent, or Bankrupts by the Iſſues of ſlender and mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Payments, the Lye is written in their Fore-heads: We live with them, we know their Poſſeſſions: Their Seats are well repaired, and bravely furniſhed; their Credit is good with our Marchants; They give Portions in Marriages with their Daughters, as great as the beſt of the King's Subjects, conſidered to have
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49492:111"/>equal Eſtates of Wealth. Their Gallantry, their Feaſting, their Revelling and Gaming are ſeen in the broad Day-light. They bear their Heads as high as their Equals in all Expences.

But your Lordſhip, ſo excellent a States-man, knows none better, that the greateſt Cheats that are put upon the World, are in the good Names of Love and Conſcience. Who hath the Power to hurt, ſo ſoon as he, that would be believed that he loves, and doth not? And who ſo dangerous to overthrow Peace, as he that pleads that Conſcience is the only Cauſe of his Diſcontents and Diſobedience?

                  <p>
                     <q>I muſt enter further into the Cloſet of this Objection. What Out-cries are theſe, that if their own Prieſts be reſtrained from them, their Souls ſhall periſh for lack of Knowledge? They that refuſe to ſerve God with the King, and his liege People, either already they know a better way, or they do not. If they do, Why do they complain, as if they were brought to the utmoſt Extremity of Periſhing for want of Inſtructions? If they do not, Why do they chooſe a contrariant Religion blindfold? Chriſtians commonly thirſt for Knowledge, not perceiving that the chief thing they want is Obedience? This Itch hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from our Blood Royal, from the Top of our Kindred in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> I amplifie my ſelf further, that I may not give Scandal, as if I did not magnifie Knowledge; and how ſhall they know and hear without a Preacher? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. I do ſubſcribe it is the Powerful Ordinance to beget Children unto Chriſt, to enliven them that are dead in their Sins; and to keep them to the Motions of Sanctity, that are raiſed up to Newneſs of Life. Whoſoever may enjoy that Bleſſing, and out of Pride contemns it, or out of Sloath difuſeth it, it will beget in him an erroneous Underſtanding, a decaying Faith, and a corrupt Life. And where the holding out of that Light is withdrawn from a Church by Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Perſecution, it is God's Curſe upon a Nation. And where it begins to clear up again, after the Interpoſition of a Total, or a partial Eclipſe, God call it his great Mercy. <hi>Thy Teachers ſhall not be removed into a Corner any more, but thine Eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers,</hi> Iſa. 30.20. But where Chriſtians know the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, both for Faith and Holineſs, yet are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Laws (whether Juſt or unjuſt, is all one to this Argument) from Church Officers to be among them, do they look to be believed when they ſay, they are quite ſtarved, becauſe none are among them, in their Senſe, lawfully ſent, to feed them with the Bread of the Goſpel? Is there no way to preſerve that which is committed to them by Meditation, by Conference, by Reading? We exact ſeverely upon them, as they cry out, becauſe we permit them not the Tongues of ſome Men to edifie them: But who are more hard-hearted? Who are they that in ſuch a Caſe of Deſtitution, will not allow them the Reading of the Scriptures, that is, the Voice of God, to ſpeak to them? As the Rock, of which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> drank, is ſaid to go along with them in the Wilderneſs, <hi>And the Rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4. So the Eſſence of a Church goes every where with them, that nouriſh the Tradition of the true Faith in their Heart. I ſay, the Church (and Chriſt ruling in it) is with ſuch, whereſoever they live,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49492:112"/>whereſoever they wander, though it be not Organized, as a complete Church ſhould be, with Biſhops and Teachers. Our Engliſh Merchants Trade many Years together at <hi>Sevile, Madrid, Alicant,</hi> and in other places, wanting the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of thoſe Churches, to whoſe Trumpets only they will hearken: Yet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live or die, many of the moſt Virtuous are well prepared for the Lord, becauſe they carry his true Church with them. He may go along in the ſtrength of the Spiritual Food, which he hath eaten, who was fed like <hi>Elijah</hi> by an Angel ſent from Heaven. Let the Plant that is newly ſet be ſtaked to prop it up, let it be water'd every Day: Doth a grown Tree require ſuch Tendance and Labour? So a People that have lived always in Gentiliſm and Idolatry, but have given ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to Evangeliſts newly to enter in among them, let them be ſwift to hear: And thoſe happy Meſſengers, that bring the Glad-tydings of Salvation into thoſe Regions of Darkneſs, let them be as ſwift to ſpeak. Who would not blow hard to make green Wood kindle? If I were in their Room, that came to lay the Foundation of Faith, where no Builder had been before, I ſhould allow my ſelf no intermiſſion of Preaching, but for ſmall Repaſt, and neceſſary Reſt. If I were in ſuch a City as <hi>Athens,</hi> that worſhipp'd an unknown God, I hope I ſhould do as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did at the ſame <hi>Athens, Acts</hi> 17.17. <hi>He Preach'd not only to the Jews and deveut Perſons in their Synagogues, but in the Market daily with thoſe that met with him.</hi> But to be inſtant with that Importunity, where a People is ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd already in all Knowledge, ſome perhaps would apply the old Proverb unto it, <hi>That it were to bring Owls to</hi> Athens. I thank your Lordſhip with all humbleneſs for your Patience and Attention: And I am ſure your Lordſhip underſtands, that it is not to be expected, that a Nation ſhould diſorder the frame of their Laws, to heap Teachers for every Sect in Religion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="223">223. <q>But the fineſt ſlight to make the reſtraint of Prieſts odious, is upon the neceſſary uſe of their Hand to confer the Sacraments. And they that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with no leſs than ſeven, will pretend ſooner to miſs their Adminiſtration, than we that give God thanks for two. My Lord, I will give no offence to your Lordſhip, upon any thing that is controverted Dogmatically between us and you, nor maintain a vexatious Problem in your hearing. I leave you to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of your Sacraments in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as they are conſtituted in ſuch Nations by the Laws of Holy Church. Sail in what Veſſels you will in your own Seas. I conſider now, I have done it often before, and with the joint ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of moſt judicious Scholars, whether thoſe Diſciples of the Roman Church, that live upon our Soil, are ſo ſtreitned in the uſe of their own Religion in this Land, that they ſhould account themſelves to be violently, and as it were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly kept from the Kingdom of Heaven, (as in thoſe words ſome of them have complain'd, and your Lordſhip ſeems to think no leſs) except that ſome of the Order of Prieſthood be permitted to be Conveyors of the Sacraments of Grace unto them. Which I conceive is not ſuitable to the Proviſions of Caſes exempt, and milder Conceſſions of their own Doctrine. The Lord Ambaſſador had been offer'd a Chair before, and refuſed it: But the Point coming as it were to the Cuſpis, or Horoſcope of Fortune, he accepted it, and ſaid, <hi>My Lord Keeper, your ſmooth Wit hath ſearch'd far into many Scruples, but this Knot will not be unlooſed with a gentle Hand, but with Violence, which is foul Play to be uſed to the ſtricteſt Bonds of Eternal Life.</hi> To which I return'd, I fear no prejudice, where ſo much Reaſon fits Judge, as your Lordſhip brings with you. So I went on. That Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which is the Introduction into Memberſhip of the Church of Chriſt is Baptiſm. The Apoſtles and their Succeſſors were appointed Stewards of it by Chriſt, to impart it to all Nations, which were call'd firſt to be his Diſciples. This is the direct way. Yet it is agreed in your Schools, That if any Chriſtian Man or Woman Baptize an Infant with the Element of Water in the right form, that is, in the Confeſſion of the Holy Trinity, the Child is ſufficiently Baptized, and is not excluded the Kingdom of Heaven, for want of that Ordinance. This ſhift is vulgarly approved among you in all places of the World. Then let that content Catholick Parents in <hi>England,</hi> which is ſo general a remedy among your own Devotees in caſe of neceſſity. And this Buſh will ſtop the firſt Gap. Next, If the Baptized die without Confirmation, none ever made it a Salvation-hazard. Eſpecially that Ceremony being not ſtubbornly rejected, but privatively inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, becauſe the proper Inſtrument is not in the way to act it. For how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Biſcainers</hi> have never heard of it? In whoſe Craggy Mountains, I am told, a Biſhop appears as ſeldom as a black Swan. I preſume your Lordſhip is a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teiner of the Canonical Privileges of Epiſcopacy; and you know without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's

Now if this Sacrament, which comes limping after Baptiſm, muſt have a Biſhop's Croſier to ſtay it up, I know not whether our Romiſh Male contents demand that? Then here's a Tale of new Tidings comes to my Ears, that, to integrate Sacred Offices, they would have the Preſence of a Biſhop, as well as of a Prieſt; and then theſe <hi>Adonijahs</hi> fly ſo high to ask for <hi>Abiſhag,</hi> that they may ask the Kingdom alſo.

                  <p>
                     <q>My Lord Ambaſſador, There is nothing diſcoverable, though the wideneſs of the Britiſh Ocean flow ſtill between us and your Biſhops, that their abſence ſhould croſs their Party that is among us from entering into Eternal Life. Which makes the Sacrament of Order not to belong to our Argument. But Marriage doth, it is Gods Ordinance, who joyned Man and Woman together in Paradiſe, and is fitteſt to be celebrated among Chriſtians in the Paradiſe of the Church-Aſſembly: And to be bleſſed by thoſe Servants of God his Prieſts, who are to bleſs his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all things, eſpecially in ſo great a Myſtery. The Queſtion is, Whether a Man ſhould ſcruple not to Wed a Woman, unleſs ſhe were joyned to him by the Prieſts of his own Communion? My Lord, Let me ſet the ſhape of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you in another Glaſs. If a Roman born and bred made choice of a Greekiſh Woman for his Wife among Greeks, in <hi>Morea</hi> or <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> would the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock be eſteemed ineffectual, if a Prieſt of the Ordination of the Greek Church did tie the Knot? The Ordination of our Clergy is nearer to you, than the Greeks. Indeed I never heard but a good Wife, and a rich Portion would be welcom to a Recuſant, though a Miniſter made by Impoſition of Hands in this Kingdom did joyn them. And I never heard that ſuch Married Ones, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of our Church to yours, were queſtion'd among you upon the Truth of their Matrimony, which they brought with them from hence. And 'tis well done of you, leſt we ſhould require Exceptions, and make the Iſſue of the moſt of the Roman Catholiques in the Land Illegitimate. It is in our Power to do ſo, becauſe they are not ſcrupulouſly Married by that Form, which our Laws have provided, and with an even Obedience to every tittle of our Preſcriptions. But many things are lawful, which are not expedient.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="224">224. <q>The Annoiting of the Sick may come in next, or in what Order you will, my Lord. I know it is called <hi>Extreme Unction</hi> in ſome Writers ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Extreme Sacrament, when the Soul is about to take its leave of all Sacraments As ſoon as I have named it, I am ready to ſhake Hands, and part with it. What if ſome, in the infirmity of their Sickneſs, deſire it, becauſe the Tradition of the Church hath commended it? Yet none is ſo ſuperſtitious to think, that Comfort cannot be infuſed into them, that are at the point of Death, ſufficiently without it. St. <hi>Stephen</hi> departed without Extreme Unction, and yet the Lord Jeſus receiv'd his Spirit. Men condemn'd by the Law, and led to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but well prepar'd for a better Life by their Ghoſtly Fathers, neither have it, nor crave it. But they that are moſt impotent, moſt affected with Languor, are ſubject to a moſt diſorder'd Appetite. Why, ſuppoſe then one that is ſick, ſhould have this Pica, and long to be Annoiled? Why might not a Lay-Friend Annoil, as well as Baptize? <hi>Eckius</hi> would have us believe that the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and your peculiar Saint, St. <hi>Genouefa,</hi> have Anointed many that were ſick, and they have recover'd. Yet leſt it ſhould be evaded, that theſe were Perſons of miraculous Endowments, hear the Words of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt, that are as large as can be, and allowed to be his, ſpeaking of this ſick Man's Salve: <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus uti Chriſtianis licet in ſuâ aut ſuorum neceſſitate inungendo.</hi> Which Papal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence our Countryman <hi>Bede</hi> quotes, and makes it full on this wiſe, not only Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, but any Chriſtians may Anoint the Infirm in caſe of neceſſity. Will you have the Judgment of ſome that are latter than <hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>Bede?</hi> Hear one, but a ſound Card, <hi>Bonaventure</hi> upon the Sentences, <hi>Poteſt diſpenſari in caſu neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatis à non Sacerdotibus.</hi> For the Sacrament of the Altar, my Lord, as you ſpeak

That is in a longer Paraphraſe, the Commandment to <hi>Take, and Eat,</hi> I and to <hi>Drink too,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be obeyed by them that can keep it: But it hath not ſuch a ſtrict tie with the Covenant of Salvation, That <hi>all they ſhall fail of final Mercy, who are impeded to partake without any fault of theirs.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants lack the taſte of that Heavenly Food, and are not prejudiced: For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour requir'd it of none, but of ſuch as could actually believe that <hi>he died for the Sins of the World.</hi> Is not the ſame Indulgence intended towards them, and far rather, who believe in Chriſt's Death, and would enjoy the Sacrament that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiates his Death, but cannot. Your Graveſt Authors do pleaſe themſelves in the Words of <hi>Rupertus,</hi> and they are grown to be the trivial Quotation upon this Caſe, <hi>Non judicatur apud Deum non manducare, niſi qui manducare noluit, qui non curavit, qui neglexit.</hi> The deſire of the Heart ſupplies the defect of actual Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. Time was more than 1300 Years ago, when thoſe that ſate at the Helm of the moſt Dignified Churches, and ſteered the Concluſions of Divine Truth, were more rigid upon this Theme, than they that hold the ſame Sees in theſe Days. They were ſo literal in the ſenſe of thoſe words, <hi>Job.</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you have no Life in you;</hi> that an Infant Baptized was preſently admitted to the Sumption of the Sacred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: That believing People, in danger to be ſeparated from their Paſtors in time of Perſecution, were ſuffered to reſerve the Conſecrated Bread, and to eat it reverently at Home. Theſe Cuſtoms are utterly melted away into diſuſe, and the latter overthrown by a Curſe in the firſt Council of <hi>Toledo.</hi> At this Day your Canons enjoyn no more, But <hi>that every faithful Man and Woman partake of Chriſts Body once a Year at</hi> Eaſter. And how gentle are your Caſuiſts in their Copious Relaxations upon the Obligation to this Canon? You ſhall hear but one ſpeak, <hi>Navarr Enchirid. Cap.</hi> 21. <hi>Every Notorious Cauſe excuſeth thoſe that receive not once a Year. And it is allowed to be a Notorious Cauſe if danger to loſe Life, or Hmour, or Fortunes doth diſtein a Chriſtian. Therefore a Woman that hath a Child at her Breaſt is diſpens'd with for the Sucklings ſake. And a Widow in ſome places, who keeps the faſhion to mourn a twelve-month at Home, before ſhe appears in publick. Nay, Caution is made to abſolve them that are raggedly, or meanly apparell'd, and would be aſhamed to have the Eyes of ſome caſt upon them in their homely Garments.</hi> You cannot go lower, unleſs you could throw leſs than one Ace upon a Dye. Excuſes you ſee are cheap, becauſe that Sacrament is not rated ſo dear, as if it were taken, or not taken upon the price of Salvation.</q>

And if we of the Reformed Clergy had not ſet before our Eyes the Naked Simplicity of the Goſpel, rather than our own Intereſts and Emolument, we would never have ridden that ſtiff-headed Beaſt the Multitude without this Bridle. The Power of the Keys, do you call it? And ſo ye may: For the Locks of all Secrets fly open before it; and every Mans Coffers are at the Command of the Confeſſon. Confeſſion of all Sin, eſpecially the moſt to be bluſh'd at, though lodged in the darkeſt Cellar of the Heart, is a heavy Burden: Yet any wiſe Man will reſolve not to be ſhame-faced, but to endure that, which he muſt bear by a rigid, and peremptory Law. If there be no remedy, as the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſay, but either reveal your Sin, even to all their Minutes and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and obtein Sacerdotal Abſolution, or never look Chriſt in the Face, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then blame your Brethren to ſay, <hi>Give us Ghoſtly Fathers, or elſe we die.</hi> But hold there. I will ſpread your own Doctrine impartially before you. Your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Writers ſay, That <hi>Confeſſion of waſting and mortal Sins is to be made to a Prieſt upon the Commandment of Chriſt.</hi> Such a Law they have fixed, partly by Conſequences, partly by their Expoſition of the Text. Now it is fit to hear what may be ſaid upon this Law, when the Caſe is removed into a Court of Equity. I move then in the behalf of a Sinner: Is he bound, as ſoon as he hath committed a mortal Sin, with all competent Celerity, to confeſs, that he may be abſolv'd? <hi>Not ſo,</hi> ſays the Chancery of Divinity. <hi>Let him proſtrate himſelf before the Knees of the Poenitentiary once a Year, and rehearſe his Crimes.</hi> Is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Scripture? Is Confeſſion once a Year of Divine Right? <hi>No,</hi> ſays old <hi>Navarr, there is no Divine expreſs Word, that chargeth the Penitent when, and how often to come to that Sacrament; but by Human Authority all Offenders are obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto once a Year.</hi>

One Exception by all Votes is admitted, <hi>That a Perſon born dumb ſhall not have his Sins reteined for want of Confeſſion,</hi> Cajet. Sacerd. Lib. 3. Cap. 6. And are not their Mouths ſtopt, as if they were dumb-born, in whoſe Vicinage, nay, in whoſe Country, none of Holy Orders out of that Tribe ought to be found by the Laws to take their Confeſſion? Or will it come to one effect, if they put down ſuch faults, as they call to mind they have committed, in writing? And ſo ſend this blotting Paper to them that have the Tutelage over them in ſuch Caſes. This Trick wants not thoſe that applaud it: Eſpecially among the Jeſuits; who I think would teach Pigeons to carry ſuch Meſſages to and fro, ſince they would have all the Work in their own Hands, and cannot be in all places. But your ſounder Divines condemn that Device: Either becauſe the Circumſtances of Sins, which alter Caſes exceedingly, cannot be Interrogated ſo well in conveyance of Letters: Or leaſt the Offendor, while his Letter is under the Meſſengers diſpatch, ſhould relapſe into his former Sin, and abuſe the Grace of Abſolution: Or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, becauſe that which is under a Mans Hand is permanent; and if it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, it may be produc'd afterwards to his ſorrow and vexation by the Secular Power.

But ſomewhat about Sacramental Confeſſions hangs yet in my Teeth; and I ſhall not ſpeak it, but ſpit it out. It is ſo reaſonable, that I beſpeak you not to be offended. He that takes it ill, it is at his own adventure. <hi>Salus populi ſuprema Lex eſto:</hi> We muſt firſt look to common ſafety. And they that think to build upon the Ruines of it, will find a falſe Foundation, I hope. Court us not ſuffer Confeſſors to creep into Corners among us. For they profeſs they will not diſcover Treaſon plotted againſt the King and Kingdom, if it be diſcloſed under that Privy Seal. Nay, it hath appeared by Examinations, by Witneſſes, by Letter under their own Hands, by all ſorts of Proofs, that they did not reveal it, when they knew the fatal Hour was at Hand, to blow up our Sovereign, the Prince his Heir, and the whole Flower of the Realm with that Infernal Powder-Plot. Not reveal it, ſaid I? Yes more, it was hatch'd in their Brain, and confirm'd with their Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. If Clanculary Confeſſion was caſt out of the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for one Mans Luſt; What juſt cauſe have we to gagg it for forty Mens Treaſon? I would have him hang'd for his Wit, that ſhould invent a way to diſcharge a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, that might give no Report. Now let me forfeit my Credit, if wiſe Men will not ſay, <hi>That Conſpiracies buzzed into the Ear, and impoſed never to be detected, upon the deepeſt Obligations of Faith, Church-Love, Merit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than Powder and Shot, that kill and crack not.</hi> Would you in good earneſt have us Repeal our Laws of Correction againſt ſuch dangerous Flambeaux? Were not that to break down our Walls, and to let in the fatal Horſe with his Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Enemies? If they plead that there is no ſuch danger in them now; Let them tell it to deaf Men. We know, and can demonſtrate, that the moſt of Contrivances againſt our State have been whetted upon the Grind-ſtone of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Our Sages that made the Laws to blow away the Locuſts into their own Red-Sea, have given us a taſte of their Malice in the Preface of the Statute <hi>Eliz.</hi> 27. <hi>That they came into the Land to work the Ruine, Deſolation and Deſtruction of the whole Realm.</hi> Therefore marvel not if ſome have loſt their Lives, that have tempted the Rigour of thoſe Laws. Neither doth it move us, that our Fugitives thereupon have ſprinkled their Calenders with new Martyrs. What if <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Prieſts had paſs'd their own Bounds, and come to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where it is likely they would have been cut off for Enemies and Rebels, ſhould their Names have been crowded into the Catalogue of the good Prophets, that were ſtoned by Tyrants? Beſhrew your Superiours beyond Seas, that Conjure up ſuch Spirits,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49492:115"/>to come into our Circle.</q> It grieves us, God knows our Hearts, to Execute our Laws upon one ot two in Seven Years for a Terror to others. But Prudence is a ſafer Virtue then Pity. And it is far better our Adverſaries ſhould be obnoxious to our Tribunal, then we to theirs, by the Thraldom of our Nation; which is the drift of thoſe unnatural Emiſſaries. And if the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that are under the Obedience of your Church, have baniſh'd ſome of that Stamp, and irrevocably, out of their Territories: Nay, if your ſelves in <hi>France</hi> did ſometimes Expel the ſame Faction, accept it favorably from us, who will never be under that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if we Baniſh all.</p>

You pleaſe your ſelf, Sir, becauſe you ask no more Liberty for your ſacrifical Prieſts in our Land, then the Reformed Miniſters enjoy with you in <hi>France.</hi> But the Compariſon doth not conſiſt of equal Terms. The Proteſtants receive a benefit of ſome Toleration in your Realm, to ſtop the miſchief of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, and to ſettle a firm Peace among your ſelves.

But ſuch a Toleration in this Kingdom would not only diſturb Peace, but with great Probability diſſolve it. In the next place you urge that ſuch a memorable Favour might be done to gratifie the ſweet Madam, our intended Princeſs, upon the Marriage. O my Lord you are driven by Blind Mariners upon a Rock. If this could be Granted by the King, which you contend for, and wereeffected; Sweet Lady, ſhe would be brought in the Curſes of this Nation, and would Repent the day, that ſhe drew the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the whole Land upon her Head. Let me ſay on the Husbands Part, what your Country-man <hi>Auſonius</hi> ſays for the Wife, <hi>Saepe in conjugiis fit noxia, ſi nimia eſt dos.</hi> If the Prince ſhould make a Joynter to his Wife out of the Tears and Sorrows of the People, it were the worſt bargain that ever he made. His Majeſties Conſort of Happy Memory Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> did not altogether concord with our Church. Indeed the Diverſity between us, and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> among whom ſhe was bred, is as little as between Scarlet and Crimſon: The Colours are almoſt of the ſame Dip. But ſhe carried it ſo prudently, that ſhe gave no notice of any diſſention: Neither ever did demand to have a Chaplain about her of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Ordination. This were a Precedent for the moſt Illuſtrious Madam to follow, rather to procure the love of the generality, then of a few Male-contents; from whom you your ſelf, my Lord, will have Cauſe to draw off, when I tell you all. They deal not with your Lordſhip ſincerely. They thruſt your whole hand into the Fire, and will not touch a Coal with one of their own Fingers. They that incite, and ſtir theſe Motions behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, dare not upon pain of their Lives ask it in Parliament, where they know the Power Reſts, and no where beſide to ratifie the Grant. And when they Solicite your Lordſhip to obtain theſe indulgences for them in the Court, they know you beat the wrong Buſh. Upon my Faith the Bird is not there.</q>

Your Lordſhip ſhall not depart from me with little Eaſe, if Truth and plain dealing will purchaſe me to be called your Friend. None can Repeal our Laws but his Majeſty, with the Votes of the three Eſtates, as you term them, the Lords Spiritual, and Temporal, and the people. And to diſpenſe with the Execution of a Law abſolutely, and unreſtreinedly, is as much as to Repeal it; which if the King ſhould aſſay, it were null in Law, and in Revenge of it in the next Parliament, it would be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter bound, and perchance the Rigour of it increaſed.

But wherein lies the way? You ſhall have better Heads then mine to help you, if you pleaſe to be directed by me. None can furniſh you with the right Art of it, but ſome of our ſage Counſellors of our Common Laws. I wiſh you therefore my Lord to proceed with the ſpecial knowledg of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks that ſtir moſt in this Project. Let them cull out ſome of the Learnedeſt Practiſers together. Let the King's Attorney General make one, for my ſake: For the reſt let your Clients pick out as they like. An hundred Crowns among them, that is, a Fee of five pounds a Man, will not be ill beſtowed upon them. Let them lay their Heads together. And I will loſe all I am worth, if you do not thank me for having referred you to thoſe, who will fetch out by their Skill ſo much to be Granted, that you will never be put to Conteſtation hereafter, that you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd much of the King, and are never the nearer. The Courtiers with whom alone you have had to do to this time, have Complemented with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. So could I do likewiſe; give you Large conceſſions in Words and in Wax; but in effect nothing. Like Galley Pots Entitled with the Name of Cordials, but have Cob-Webs in them, and no more.

                     <hi>Sir,</hi> ſays the Embaſſador, <hi>Uſe me honeſtly. I am a Stranger, and while I am in</hi> England, <hi>I will ſurrender up ſelf to your Directions. Nay, I will poſſeſs our Virtuous, and Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Madam, that you are a clear dealing Man, and of good Faith, and moſt worthy of her Truſt, when ſhe comes into a ſtrange Land.</hi> And after a very civil Farewel at the preſent, Mounſieur <hi>Villoclare</hi> made uſe of thoſe Inſtructions; <hi>For though he Climbed not ſo High as he looked, yet he Climbed better; for he ſtood ſure, where he could not fall.</hi>

                  <p n="228">228. Which Papers came to the King, with more ſatisfaction, as he was pleas'd to ſay, then he could have expected. Not any Line of Wiſdom or Learning could be loſt to him, who ſaw as far, and as ſoon as any Man, into the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals of another. For, as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> wrote, his Majeſty had a light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which had ſuch readineſs to take Flame, and blaze from the leaſt occaſion preſented, on the leaſt ſpark of anothers knowledg deliver'd, as was to be admir'd. And this was the laſt preſent in that kind, that the Lord Keeper ſent to the King; who finding ſome indiſpoſition of Health, retired for freſh Air and quietneſs to his Mannor of <hi>Theobalds, VVhere</hi> Jacob <hi>gather'd up his Feet into the Bed, and yielded up the Ghoſt,</hi> Gen. 49.33. The Lord Keeper on <hi>March</hi> 22. being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> receiv'd a Letter from the Court, that it was feared his Majeſties Sickneſs was dangerous to Death; which Fear was the more confirm'd, for he, diſpatching away in all haſte, met with Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> in the Road, who told him, That the King us'd to have a Beneficial Evacuation of Nature, a ſweating in his left Arm, as helpful to him as any Fontinel could be; which of late had failed. And that argued, that the former Vigour of Nature was low, and ſpent. This Symptome of the Kings Weakneſs I never heard from any elſe. Yet I believe it upon ſo learned a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Obſervation. And this might well cauſe a Tertian Ague, and a Mortal, when the Spring had Entred ſo far, able to make a commotion in the Humours of the Body, and not to expel them, with accuſtom'd vaporation. After the L. Keeper had preſented himſelf before his Lord the King, he moved him unto chearful Diſcourſe, but it would not be: He continued til Midnight at his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and perceiv'd no Comfort; but was out of all Comfort upon the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Phyſicians held together in the Morning. Preſently he beſought the Prince, that he might acquaint his Father with his Feeble Eſtate, and like a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chaplain mind him both of his Mortality, and Immortality; which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and committed to him, as the principal Inſtrument of that Holy and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Service. So he went into the Chamber of the King again upon that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and Kneeling at his Palat, told his Majeſty, <q>He knew he ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſpleaſe him, nor diſcourage him, if he brought <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Meſſage to <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> to ſet his Houſe in Order; for he thought his Days to come would be but few in this World, but the beſt remained for the next World.</q> 
                     <hi>I am ſatisfied,</hi> ſays the Sick King; <hi>and I pray you aſſiſt me to make me ready to go away hence to Chriſt, whoſe Mercies I call for, and I hope to find them.</hi> After this the Keeper, now of his Majeſties Soul, kept about him with as much Diligence, as a Body of Fleſh could endure. He was ever at hand; helpful not only in Sacred, but in every kind of Duty; never from that time put off his Cloaths to go to Bed, till his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had put off his Tabernacle, which appear'd in his Looks on <hi>Sunday</hi> Night,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49492:116"/>when he return'd to <hi>VVeſtminſter;</hi> employed himſelf Night and Day, unleſs the Phyſicians did compoſe his Majeſty to reſt, in Praying, in Reading, moſt of all in Diſcourſing about Repentance, Faith, Remiſſion of Sins, Reſurrection, and Eternal Life. To which the King made Anſwer, ſometimes in Latin, always with Patience, and full of Heavenly Seaſoning; which Hallowed Works were performed between them on <hi>VVedneſday,</hi> as a Preparation to the Paſſover on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the Fortifying of his Majeſties Soul againſt the Terrors of Death, with the lively Remembrance of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion in the Holy Communion. At which the King made moſt humble Conſeſſion of his Sins, craved Abſolution, rendred the Confeſſion of his Faith before many Witneſſes, Profeſs'd he Died in the Boſom of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Doctrine he had defended with his Pen, being perſwaded it was according to the mind of Chriſt, as he ſhould ſhortly Anſwer it before him.</p>
                  <p n="229">229. All this while God did lend him ſuch Strength, to utter himſelf how well he Reliſh'd that Sacred Banquet of Chriſt's Body and Blood, and how comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt did flow into his Soul, as if he had been in a way of Recovery. And his mournful Servants that ſaw and heard it, rejoyced greatly, that unto that time Sickneſs did not compreſs his Underſtanding, nor ſlop his Speech, nor Debilitate his Senſes, and ſubmitted more willingly to God to have their Maſter taken from their Head, becauſe they believed the Lord was ready to receive him into Glory. The next day his Soul began to Retreat more inward, and ſo by degrees to take leſs and leſs Notice of external things. His <hi>Cuſtos An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus,</hi> as I may call him, his Devoted Chaplain ſtirr'd very little out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sorrow, both to give an Far to every Word the King ſpake in that extream condition, and to give it him again with the Uſe of ſome Divine Meditation; as alſo to Repulſe thoſe who crept much about the Chamber Door (he was ſure for no good) Nay, and into the Chamber. They were of the moſt addicted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom he controuled for their Sawcineſs, and commanded them as a Privy Counſellor further off. Impoſtors, that are accuſtom'd to beſtow Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick Lies upon the beſt Saints of God, and whom they cannot pervert living, to challenge for theirs when they are Dead. So, being rid of theſe Locuſts, he was continually in Prayer, while the King linger'd on, and at laſt ſhut his Eyes with his own Hand, when his Soul departed. Whatſoever belong'd to Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the Royal Exequies fell to his part afterward. He perform'd the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Burial, when the Body was repoſed in the Vault of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths Chappel, appointed only for that famous King's Poſterity, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. He Preach'd the Sermon at the Magnificent Funeral, out of the 2 <hi>Chron. c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 29.30. and part of the 31. <hi>Now the reſt of the Acts of</hi> Solomon <hi>Firſt and Laſt are they not written in the Rock of</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet, and in the Propheſie of</hi> Ahijah <hi>the</hi> Shilonite, <hi>and in the Viſions of</hi> Iddo <hi>the Seer againſt</hi> Jeroboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Nebat? <hi>And</hi> Solomon <hi>Reigned in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>over</hi> Iſrael <hi>Fourty Years. And</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>ſlept with his Fathers and was Buried in the City of</hi> David <hi>his Father;</hi> and no further. Out of which Text he fetch'd two <hi>Solomons,</hi> and Match'd them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And I conceive he never Studied any thing with more care, to deliver his mind <hi>apud honores,</hi> exactly to the Truth, and Honour of the King. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after the Sermon which Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> made at the Funeral of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, and procur'd it; likewiſe for the Oration which Cardinal <hi>Peron</hi> made for King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> and had it by the means of Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin</hi> the Father. Theſe he laid before him to work by, and no common Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns. 'Tis uſeleſs to Blazon this Sermon in the Quarters; take it altogether, and I know not who could mend it. It is in the Libraries of Scholars that are able to judg of it. And ſuch as Read it ſhall wrong King <hi>Charles</hi> his Son, if they conceive any Paſſage Reflects upon him, becauſe Eloquence in the Body of the Sermon, and in the Margent is commended in King <hi>James,</hi> and Extoll'd to be very uſeful in Government. Doth this derogate from the Honour of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlor.

                  <p n="231">231. But our King <hi>James</hi> did not weigh which was cheapeſt or deareſt, Peace or War; but which was more anſwerable to times of Grace, and the Aeconomy of the Goſpel. For Thriſt and Saving, he could never be brought to think of them. I have heard, that he never loved a Servant till he had given him enough for a Livelihood; and ſuſpected thoſe that were modeſt, and did not ask, as if they loved not him. It might rightly be ſaid of his Exchequer, what <hi>Salmaſius</hi> notes upon <hi>Lampridius Diadumenns, Praefectus aerarii comes largitionum vocatur; quaſi ad nullam aliam rem princeps aerarium haberet, quàm ad largiendum.</hi> The chief Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer was called the Count of Largeſs, as if the Prince's Revenue ſerved only for Bounty and Largeſs. But as wiſe <hi>Spotſwood</hi> ſays upon <hi>Malcolm</hi> the Second. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is the Companion of immoderate Largition, and forceth to unlawful Shifts.</hi> Therefore it is better for a Prince to proportion Giſts to his own Revenews, than to the Expectation of publick Supplies. Thus far King <hi>James</hi> may be magnified, he ſpent to pleaſe his Mind in gratifying and obliging many, not to pleaſe his Body. His Cloaths were thriſty, and of better Example than his Courtiers would follow. He was temperate in his Diet, ſays Sir <hi>An. W.</hi> and to be believed, becauſe in every thing almoſt he is an affected Defamer; but this he knew well, for he was Clerk of the Kitchin, and waited at the Table. Where, as an eye Witneſs, he adds, that he was temperate alſo in his Drinking, drinking often, but very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not above one or two Spoonfuls at once, which Strangers obſerving, and not knowing the ſmall quantity he ſip'd, carried away an Error with them, which grew into a falſe Fame: But I never ſpake with that Man that ſaw him overtaken. Take him for a Scholar, and he had gathered Knowledge to aſtoniſhment; and was ſo expert to uſe it, that had he been born in a private Fortune, he might have deſerved to be a Biſhop of the higheſt Promotion. Let the Learnedeſt of the Nobility, the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> ſpeak for the Learnedeſt of Monarchs. There hath not been ſince Chriſt's Time, any King, which hath been ſo Learned in all Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and Erudition, Divine and Humane. And let him win and wear that in <hi>Auſon, Paneg.</hi> which cannot be denied him, <hi>Quid aliud es quàm ex omni bonarum artium ingenio collecta perfectio?</hi> Piety is the Baſis of all Vertue, and the Baſis of Piety in corrupted Nature, is rather Repentance than Innocency. When this King called to mind in his Retiring-Chamber, or in his Bed, that he had been that Day overtaken with Paſſion, <hi>As he that offends not in Word, the ſame is a per-Man, Jam.</hi> 3.2. he uſed to ſend for Biſhop <hi>Montague,</hi> the only Prelate that ever was ſworn of his Bed-Chamber, or for Dr. <hi>Young,</hi> the Dean of <hi>Winton,</hi> whom he would exhort to Pray with him for the Forgiveneſs of his Sins. He was infinitely given to Prayer, ſays Sir <hi>Ant. W.</hi> but more out of Fear than Conſcience. That's Satan's Gloſs upon a good Text. What Fear ſhould move him to Prayer, but that which is the beginning of Wiſdom? Few dye Saints, that live Libertines. God would not have impowered him to expreſs ſuch good Effects of Religion, at his parting out of this Life, if he had not been his faithful Servant in his Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To trumpet theſe, and many more Triumphs of Praiſe, Fame, will wake for him, now he is faln aſleep. And the more Ages to come that will ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy him, the more they will renown him. I have read it quoted out of <hi>Galen,</hi> that the Surentine Wine is never mellow for the Taſte till it be ſeventy years old; and becauſe few will keep it ſo long, the Goodneſs is little known. So the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the World keeps this King's Memory, it will be the ſweeter. Perhaps it is yet harſh to ſome malevolous and unthankful.</p>

Eſpecially it is to be deplored, and defied, that ſome are ſo touchy upon the niceſt Points of Religion, that they will not ſpare the Good Name, no, not of the Lord's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, if he have diſtaſted them with Oppoſition of Opinions, if he not dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize with them in all abſtruſe and intricate Problems of almoſt unſearchable Truths. For which, they that ſue their Adverſaries hotly, and, as it were, go to Law for every Quirk and knotty Point, are no better than common Barretters in Divinity.

'Tis common to ſee a Stock ingrafted with two forts of Fruits. The Almighty Planter ſhews greater differences, when he pleaſeth, in Moral, than in Natural Plantations. As he ordain'd the Noble <hi>Williams</hi> to become two contrary Parts, as well as any Man had perform'd them in five Ages before him, keeping the golden Mean in the Tryals of the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and of the Leſt, being neither corrupted with the Advancements, nor the Perſecutions of the Times: As <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were neither tranſported with the Honours which the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> did intend, nor deterr'd with the Stones which they caſt at them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.

Which is to be demonſtrated in the Subject that I write of, as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. King <hi>Charles</hi> began his Reign <hi>Mart.</hi> 27. 1625. The next day he ſent for the Lord-Keeper to his Court at St. <hi>James</hi>'s: who found his Majeſty and the Lord-Duke buſied in many Cares. The King ſpake firſt of ſetling his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: among whom the Keeper commended two out of his own Family to be preſerr'd; but it was paſt over without an Anſwer: only his Domeſtick Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was taken into ordinary Service, for whom he had made no ſuit. But to begin the well-ordering of the new Court, he was appointed to give the Oath to the Lords of the Privy-Council, Sir <hi>Humphrey May</hi> taken into the Number, a very wiſe States man, and no more of a new Call. Then likewiſe order was given for the Funerals of the deceaſed King, and the Keeper choſen to Preach on the occaſion: of which enough is ſaid already by a convenient Anticipation. The Coronation was ſpoken of, though the time was not determin'd. Yet the King told the Keeper he muſt provide a Sermon for that likewiſe: but he that beſpoke him was of another mind, before the Day of the Solemnization was ripe. That which was much inſiſted upon at this Conſult was a Parliament. His Majeſty being ſo forward to have it ſit, that he did both propound, and diſpute it, to have no Writs go forth to call a new one, but to continue the ſame which had met in one Seſſion in his bleſſed Father's days, and prorogued to another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Spring. The Lord-Keeper ſhewed, That the old Parliament deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with his death that call'd it in his own Name, and gave it Authority to meet. Since neceſſity requir'd a new Choice, the King's Will was, That Writs ſhould be diſpatcht from the <hi>Chancery</hi> forthwith, and not a day to be loſt. The Keeper craved to be heard, and ſaid it was uſual in times before, that the King's Servants, and truſtieſt Friends did deal with the Countries, Cities and Boroughs, where they were known, to procure a Promiſe for their Elections, before the preciſe time of an inſequent Parliament was publiſht; and that the ſame Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt would be good at that time: which would not ſpeed, if the Summons were divulged, before they lookt about them. The King anſwer'd, <hi>It was high time to have Subſidies granted for the maintaining of a War with the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and the Fleet muſt go forth for that purpoſe in the Summer.</hi> The Keeper ſaid little again, leſt Fidelity ſhould endanger a Suſpicion of Malice: and he little dreamt that the Almanack of the new Year, or new Reign, was ſo ſoon calculated for the Longitude of a War, and the Latitude of vaſt Sums of Money to pay the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Yet he replied in a few words, but with ſo cold a conſent, that the King turned away, and gave him leave to be gone. He that was not chearful to ſay good Luck have you with that Expedition, was not thought worthy to have an Oar in the great Barque, which was launching out, and making ready for the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49492:121"/>King's Marriage with the ſweet Lady of <hi>France.</hi> Yet who but he to treat with Embaſſadors of that Nation, and on that Score, in his old Maſter's time? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Cares that came into Conſideration that day in the ſulneſs of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this had the ſtart, and was haſtned the ſame Morning with Poſts and Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets. <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Wings could not poſſibly fly faſter. Yet his Majeſty ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it to this able Counſellor, although the Rumor of it in a Week was heard from <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Twede.</hi> And the Duke began to hold no Conference with him: neither from that day did he call for this <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and ſay, Bring hither the <hi>Ephod</hi> to ask Counſel of the Lord. Evident Tokens to make any Man ſee what would come after, that was far leſs than a Prophet. Which this wife Man paſt over, and ſeem'd to obſerve nothing that was ominous, or unfriendly. But as Lord <hi>Mornay</hi> ſays in his Anſwer about the Conference at <hi>Fountain-bleau,</hi> when <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> forbad him coming to the <hi>Louver. Specto eclipſin, &amp; expecto intrepidus, ſecurus quid illa ſecum vehat:</hi> So the Lord-Keeper was better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Heaven, than to be troubled at an Eclipſe, which is an accident prodigious to none but to a Fool, but familiar to a Philoſopher. And he had learnt in the Morals by heart, that the way to loſe Honour is, to be too careful to keep it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. While the great Aſſairs did run thus, the Keeper went cloſe to his Book, as much as publick buſineſs would allow, to frame a Sermon againſt the Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of bleſſed <hi>James.</hi> He did not conceive, that the Counſels which he gave to the King, on the ſecond day of his Reign, were ſo ill taken, as he heard not long after. He that ſpeaks with the truſt of a Counſellor, and, which is more, with the Tongue of a Biſhop, ſhould be priviledged to be plain, and faithful without offence. As St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> mindeth <hi>Theodoſius, Ep.</hi> 29. <hi>Non eſt imperiale libertatem dicendi negare, neque ſacerdotale quid ſentias non dicere.</hi> But News knockt at his Study-door two days after, that my Lord-Duke threatned before many that attended, to turn him out of his Office. And the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadors were not the laſt that gave him warning of it. Theſe Rumors he lookt upon with his Eyes open, and ſaw the approaching of a Downfal, and ſo little diſſembled it, that he warn'd ſome of his Followers ſecretly, who were in beſt account with him, to procure dependance upon ſome other Maſter, for his Service e're long would not be worthy of them. It were to ſmall purpoſe to enquire, why the Duke's Grace did ſo haſtily preſs the Ruine of one, that had been his old Friend and Creature. It was his game, and he lov'd it. I have ſeen a Manuſcript of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbots,</hi> ſtating the Reaſon of his own Relegation to Ford in <hi>Kent</hi> (the Papers were written with his own Hand to my knowledge) wherein he paints the Fickleneſs of the great Duke, to ſet up and pluck down, with theſe Lines. Firſt, <hi>He wanted not Suggeſtors to make the worſt of all Mens Actions, whom they could miſreport.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He loved not that any Man ſhould ſtick too long in a Place of Greatneſs.</hi> He hit the Nail in that. For this Keeper continued the longeſt in a great Office, of any that he had lifted up, and did live to uſe them. Which proceeded not from his Grace's Conſtancy, but from the good-liking of the old King. But as <hi>Symmachus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Polemio,</hi> Lib. 2. Ep. 14. <hi>Sic amicis uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quaſi ſloribus, tam diu gratis, quàm diu recentibus.</hi> So my young Lord chang'd his Friends as Men do Flowers; he lik'd a Scent no longer than it was freſh. Indeed he lookt from his Vaſſals for more than they could do, and hurried to make tryal of thoſe that would do more. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſays the Arch-biſhop again, <hi>He ſtood upon ſuch fickle Terms, that he feared his own Shadow, and deſperately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventur'd upon many things for his own Preſervation.</hi> Too true, for by this time he had loſt the People: in whoſe good Opinion he thought he ſtood for the ſpace of Nine Months. Alas, he had a ſlight faſtning in them: for he never got their Love, further than his Hatred to <hi>Spain</hi> procur'd it. And that was ſpent out, upon an exacter Information of his bearing at <hi>Madrid.</hi> This was the Jealouſie which gave the Lord-Keeper the deadly Stoccada, who would not abuſe his own Knowledge ſo far, to extol my Lord for his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tranſactions, which broke the Peace, the Credit, the Heart of his King, and his Patron, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited. Therefore that he was fallen in leſs than a Year from the abundance of a great Eſteem, he thought he might thank the Keeper, whoſe down-right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty gave the Example. More may be ſaid: but once more ſhall ſuffice; the Duke had attempted with King <hi>James,</hi> that which he threatned now: but his Majeſty that then was did not allow of it: and charged them both to unite, and to work friendly together for his Service. But that mighty Lord waited the opportunity to root up the Tree, which he had gone about to unfaſten. For
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49492:122"/>commonly the offended Perſon is an Eye-fore to him that did offend him. And ſuch as have done great wrongs, are afraid of thoſe, whom they have provok'd, and can never after affie in them: So it was among the Rules of <hi>Michael Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talius</hi> (the beſt of the Chancellors of <hi>France,</hi> and yet in a Pet caſhiered from keeping the Great-Seal) as <hi>Thuanus</hi> remembers it, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1568. <hi>Principum docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum eſſe, ut iis nunquam ſerio reconcilientur, quos temerè offenderint.</hi> This, as it is related, was our Duke's Temper. And the Keeper underſtood that no Peace was to be had from an Adverſary ſeeded with ſuch Qualities. All that he could do to help himſelf, was not by preventing, but by retarding a Miſchief. For though with the Stoick's Fate was inevitable: Yet <hi>Servius</hi> ſays in 8. <hi>Lib. Aen.</hi> that his great Poet thought, it might be deferr'd, though not avoided. Two things ſtuck to the Keeper like Sorrows, and gave him all the unreſt that he had. Firſt, <hi>He wiſh'd that his depoſing might have come from any hand, but his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons that raiſed him: before whom he would fall, rather than wreſtle with him as an Enemy.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He had read much to teach him, and ſeen the Proof of it, that when Princes call back their Honours, more Miſery enſues.</hi> But as yet he ſtood his ground, and did become his Place as well as ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He never made uſe ſo much of his whole ſtock of Worth, and Wiſdom, as in matter of Religion; which appears before in the Mazes, wherein he led the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador, with whom he ſhiſted ſo cunningly, that they could obtain nothing for the Toleration of Popiſh Recuſants, but Delays and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from time to time. Neither could the <hi>Monſieurs</hi> ſqueeze any more out of him, againſt the Ratification of the <hi>French</hi> Marriage, as appears in a bare Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before K. <hi>James</hi> died, witneſs the Letter written to the Duke, <hi>March</hi> 13. 1624. <hi>Cabal. p.</hi> 105. If your Grace ſhall hear the Embaſſador complain of the Judges in their Charges, of their receiving Indictments, your Grace may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that thoſe Charges are but Orations of courſe, opening all the Penal Laws: And the Indictments, being preſented by the Country, cannot be refuſed by the Judges. But the Judges are ordered to execute nothing actually againſt the Recuſants, nor will they do it during the Negotiation. And your Grace may put him in mind, that the Lord-Keeper doth every day, when his (the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors) Secretary calls upon him, grant forth Writs, to remove all the Perſons In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in the Country into the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> out of the Power and Reaches of the Juſtices of Peace. And that being there the King may, and doth releaſe them at his Pleaſure. In all this there is no bar againſt the common Courſe of Law, but Mercy reſerv'd to the Royal Pleaſure. Now what cauſe had my Lord Duke to defie him by his Secretary, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 87. That his Courſes were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to his Country, and prejudicial to the Cauſe of true Religion? Forſooth, becauſe he proffer'd a Gap to be opened to the Immunities of the Papiſts in a deſperate Plunge, to bring the Prince home ſafe out of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he ſtuck faſt for want of ſuch a Favour to be ſhewn to thoſe Complainants. Which was a liberal Conceſſion in Promiſe, but no Date ſet, nor obſerv'd for the Expedition of it. And ſo all that Indulgence which hung in <hi>nubibus,</hi> and never dropt down, is frankly granted now, and he is commanded by this Warrant that follows, to ſignifie to all Officers, to ſuſpend the Laws which are grievous to the Romiſh Profeſſion, dated 1 <hi>Car. May</hi> the firſt.</p>

There was no ſcrupling of this Order, but it muſt be diſpatch'd. For though, as a great Counſellor, the Keeper was to be watchful over the Voices and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the People, and that he knew this was not the Courſe to keep the Subject in terms of Contentment, yet he had no power to ſtop the Tide, as in former days. My Lord of <hi>Buckin.</hi> would not ſtay to hear the Arguments of his Wiſdom. <hi>Altiſſimo orbe, &amp; praecipuâ potentiâ ſtella Saturni fortur,</hi> Tacit. 1 liſt. lib. 5. The Planet of <hi>Saturn</hi> was in the higheſt Orb, and ruled all the Influence of the Court. Where was now the Cavil againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, that in the Treaty for it, it encroach'd too far upon Religion? Indeed my Lord of <hi>Kenſington</hi> writes from <hi>Paris, Cab.</hi> p. 275. <hi>The</hi> French <hi>will not ſtrain us to any unreaſonableneſs in Conditions for the Catholicks.</hi> And as much again, <hi>p.</hi> 284. <hi>Their Pulſe in matter of Religion beats temperately.</hi> So he told us in another Pacquet, <hi>p.</hi> 292. <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>will never abandon us in the Action for the recovering the Palatinate.</hi> Which of theſe Engagements were broken laſt? a more ſolid Queſtion than to ask, Which of their Promiſes were kept firſt? They kept none. Some chop out Promiſes, as Nurſes tell Tales to Children, to lull them aſleep: As it is in the neat Phraſe of <hi>Arnobius, Somno occupari ut poſſint, leves audiendoe ſunt naenioe.</hi> The Hiſtories of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as well as of <hi>England,</hi> do not ſpare to touch that Noble Nation, that none have taken greater liberty to play faſt and looſe with Articles and Covenants. And as the <hi>French</hi> were inconſtant to us, ſo new Symptoms, and new Apprehenſions made us variable, and inconſtant to our ſelves. Now a Letter muſt be ſent to all Magiſtrates Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to cauſe them to ſuſpend the Execution of all Laws againſt the Papiſts. At the Term at <hi>Reading</hi> in <hi>November</hi> following, Divulgation is made in all Courts under the Broad-Seal, that all Officers and Judges ſhould proceed againſt them according to Law. After the Second Parliament of King <hi>Charles</hi> was broken up, that is, in the Summer that followed the Term at <hi>Reading,</hi> by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador, Marſhal <hi>Baſſampere,</hi> new Letters come from the King to redintegrate Favours to the Recuſants, and that all Purſevants muſt be reſtrained, and their Warrants to ſearch the Houſes of Papiſts taken from them. And this continued but till Winter. It was ſafe and juſt to return quickly again into the High-way of the Law: for the ſhorteſt Errors are the beſt: Eſpecially in God's Cauſe. Which <hi>Vincen.

                  <p n="5">5. Private Men may better keep this Rule, than ſuch as are publickly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the State. But though the Keeper had no remedy, but the preceding Warrant muſt be obeyed: Yet he tryed his Majeſty how his Service would be taken; in ſtopping a Warrant upon another occaſion, bearing date <hi>May</hi> 23. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſumptuous Entertainment of the Queen, and her magnificient Convoy being ready to land, would be very chargeable, he thruſt in his Judgment to adviſe the King againſt diſorderly Liberality.

                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> Received this Morning a Warrant from your most Excellent Majeſty, to paſs a Grant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great-Seal of <hi>England,</hi> of the Sum of Two thouſand Pounds, out of the Court of Wards, to my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> for Twenty One Years to come. The which I durſt not for fear of infringing my Duty to your Majeſty, and drawing ſome danger upon my ſelf, paſs under the Great-Seal, before I had made unto your moſt Excellent Majeſty this moſt humble Repreſentation. <hi>Firſt,</hi>The iſſuing of ſo great a Leaſe of ſuch a vast Sum of Money is (under your Majeſty's Favour and Correction) diſadvantageous to your Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in regard of the time, being in the face of that Parliament, from which your Majeſty is to expect a main Supply. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is (I believe) without Prſident or Example, that Penſions have been granted in Contemplation of Services for Years: But for the Party's Life only. My Lord of <hi>Middleſex</hi> his Leaſe of the Sugars is the only Preſident in that kind, which hath hapned during the time of my Service in this Place. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>The Aſſigning of this Penſion upon the Court of Wards, or any other Place, than the Receipt of the Exchequer, is directly againſt the Rules and Orders, taken, upon mature deliberation, by your Father of Bleſſed Memory. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This great Lord (for ſo be is indeed) is in the Eye and the Envy of many Men, as your Majeſty (I fear it) will hear e're long. As having received more great Favours within theſe two Years, than any Three Subjects within this Kingdom. Although I do believe (looking up to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49492:123"/>the hands that conferred them) he may well deſerve them all. Moſt gracious Sovereign, I am not ignorant of the danger I incur in making this Repreſentation. But I have put on an irremoveable Reſolution, that as long as you are pleaſed to continue me in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I will never from this time forth, out of Contemplation of mine own Safety, or any other carnal Reſpect, neglect voluntarily any part of my Duty to my God, or my King. Which I ſuppoſe I had greatly forgotten, without preſenting your moſt Excellent Majeſty with this Remonſtrance. And having perform'd this part of my Duty, I ſhall most punctually obey your Majeſty's Direction in this particular.</p>

                  <p>For this good Service it was well he had no check: yet he had no gra-mercy, to ſeem wiſer than thoſe that had prepared the buſineſs. And though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for that Penſion was a flat Violation of good Order, yet the Plea was, it would be unkind to revoke it. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Agis</hi> obſerves it in ſome Mens Humours, <hi>Though a thing be ill undertaken, it is held a ſhame to go back.</hi> This Lord Secretary was the Keeper's cold Friend upon it; but he lived not long, and quitted his Office before he ceaſed to live: Only ſome deckings of empty Titles were given him, that he might not faint. The moſt that was diſliked in the Letter was, that it warn'd the Secretary, that he was like to hear himſelf nam'd among the Grievances of the enſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherein he did not fail. It was no hard thing to Prognoſtick ſuch a Tempeſt, from the hollow murmuring of the Winds abroad. There was not ſuch a Watch-man about the Court as the Keeper was, to eſpy Diſcontents in the dark: nor any one that had ſo many Eyes abroad in every corner of the Realm. What hurt was it? Nay, Why was it not call'd a Courteſie, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a Friend, purſued by danger, out of prudent Collections? Says a wiſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator, <hi>Tul. Act.</hi> 7. in <hi>Verrem, Judex eſſe bonus non poteſt, qui ſuſpicione certâ non mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur,</hi> He is no ſound judge of Rumors, that gleans not up a certain Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of ſtrong Suſpicions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To ſpeak forward. After the Queen had been receiv'd with much luſtre of Pomp, and Courtſhip (which had been more, if a very peſtilentious Seaſon in <hi>London,</hi> and far and wide, had not frown'd upon publick Reſorts, and full Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities) a Parliament began. Stay a while, and hear that in a little, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns much that followed. This is the higheſt and ſupereminent Court of our Kings. The Univerſity of the whole Realm, where the Graduates of Honour, the Learned in the Laws, and the beſt Practicers of Knowledge and Experience in the Land do meet. <hi>Horreum ſapientiae,</hi> or the full <hi>Chorus,</hi> where the Minds of many are gather'd into one Wiſdom. And yet in five Parliaments, which this King call'd, there was diſtance, and diſorder in them all between him and his People. <hi>Amabile eſt praeeſſe civibus, ſed placere difficile,</hi> as <hi>Symmachus</hi> to his Lord <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> Our Sovereign had not the Art to pleaſe: or rather his Subjects had not the Will to be pleaſed. And we all ſee by the Event, that God was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd upon it. If he had won them, or they had won him, neither had been loſers. <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Fable, or Story of the Two Goats, <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 50. Suits the Caſe; <hi>The Two Goats met upona narrow Bridge; the one laid down his Body for the other to go over him, or both had been thruſt into the River.</hi> In the Application, who had done beſt to have yielded is too myſterious to determine. Both, or either, had done well. But now we ſee, and ſhall feel it, I believe, it is not Love, nor Sweetneſs, nor Sufferance that keeps a Nation within the ſtraits of due Obedience: it muſt be Power that needs not to entreat. The Scepter can no more than propound: the Sword will carry it. This Truth was once little worn: but now it is upon our backs, and we are like to wear it ſo long, till we are all Thread-bare. <hi>Thucyd. lib.</hi> 2. ſays of <hi>Theſeus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Theſeus</hi> govern'd <hi>Athens,</hi> being as potent as wiſe. His Wiſdom taught the <hi>Athenians</hi> to keep a good pace: but Awe and Potency did bridle, and compel them to ſuffer their Rider, or elſe they would have thrown him. King <hi>Charles</hi> knew how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, as well as <hi>Theſeus.</hi> But he was not ſo ſtout: I am ſure not ſo ſtrong. His Condition in the preſent ſtood thus. When he was Prince he was the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Mediator from the Parliament to extort a War againſt <hi>Spain</hi> from his Father. Of which Deſign he was but the Lieutenant before: is now become the Captain. He ſets the Action on foot, and calls for Contribution to raiſe, and pay an Army. Inſtead of ſatisfaction in Subſidies (two alone granted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the charge of the great Funeral paſt, and the Coronation to come) they call for Reformation in Government. One lifts up a Grievance, and another a Grievance, and ſtill the Cry continues, and multiplies. As they ſpake with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49492:123"/>many Tongues, ſo I would they could have taken up Serpents, and felt no harm. The plain Senſe of it is, thoſe ſubtile Men of the lower Houſe put the young King upon the puſh of Neceſſity, and then took advantage of the Time, and that Neceſſity. They had caſt his Affairs into want of Money, and he muſt yield all that they demanded, or elſe get no Money, without which the War could not go on. Here was the Foundation laid of all the Diſcontents that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>A capite primùm computreſcit piſcis,</hi> ſays the Proverb. If they had anſwer'd with that Confidence and Love, as was invited from them, <hi>England</hi> had not ſat in ſorrow as at this day. And I will as ſoon die as retract theſe words, that all Affairs might have been in a moſt flouriſhing Eſtate, if the People in that, or in any Parliament, had been as good as the King: <hi>Optimos gubernatores hand mediocriter etiam manus remigum juvat,</hi> Symmach. p. 128. The Pilot ſpends his breath in vain, if the Oar-men will not ſtrike a ſtroke: A good Head can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without their Hands. If I ſhould hold yet, that this King was to be blam'd in nothing, I ſhould ſpeak too highly of Humane Nature. They that paſs through much buſineſs, cannot chooſe but incur Errors, which will fall under Cenſure; yet it were better under Pardon. The moſt that aggrieved the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Parliament was, that the King's Conceſſions for the good of the People came not off chearfully. He wanted a way indeed to give a Gift, and to make it thank-worthy in the manner of beſtowing. A ſmall Exception: when one grave Sentence from his Mouth did mean more reality, than a great deal of Volubility with ſweetneſs and ſmiling: to which, I confeſs, they had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately uſed. But when all is done, as the Poets ſay, <hi>The Muſes ſing ſweeter than the Syrens; and a ſullen ſomething is better than a gracious nothing.</hi>

Good Seed it was, yet it came not up well, although it was water'd with two ſhowers of Eloquence by the Lord-Keeper, the firſt directed to the Lords, and Commons; the other to Sir <hi>Thomas Crew</hi> the Speaker.

                        <p>YOU have heard his Majeſty's Speech, though ſhort, yet Full and Princely, and rightly Imperatorious, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Galbas:</hi> Neither muſt we account that Speaker to be ſhort, <hi>Qui materiae immoratur,</hi> that keeps himſelf cloſe unto his Theme, and Subject. For as <hi>Pliny</hi> made his cenſure of<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil, Brevis uterque eſt, ſed facit quod inſtituit:</hi>Either of them ſeem to be ſhort, for they do their work ſo ſuccinctly, there falls not a word beſides the purpoſe. His Majeſty hath himſelf abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſt the ſubſtance, of what he offers to your Conſideration at this Meeting. Some few Circumſtances I ſhall, by his Royal Command, add thereunto, as touching the time, the manner, and the end of that loving and dutiful Expreſſion, which his Majeſty may, without any fear of Immodeſty, as he conceives, promiſe unto himſelf from this firſt Seſſion of his firſt Parliament. The main reaſon of his calling the Parliament at this time (beſide the looking upon the Faces of his Subjects in this perfect repreſentation, which he is reſolv'd to make his moſt pleaſant Theater under Heaven, as long as God ſhall give him Life) is to let you underſtand thoſe deep Engagements for the recovery of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate</hi> (that is for the Honour of the Britiſh Nation) by Leagues, Alliances, Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Wars by Sea and by Land which his aying Father hath impoſed upon the King; or peradventure the King in part upon his Father: or rather, to ſpeak truly and hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, your ſelves (but upon grave and juſt Conſideration) upon them both. For the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of both the Treaties with that potent King, that of the Alliance, and that of the Reſtitution, moved originally from you, mediately by the King our Sovereign, finally to the King his Father of Bleſſed Memory, accompanied in all the Ways, and Paſſages with your Promiſe, and Aſſurance, to feed the Enterprize from time to time with all fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ing, and neceſſary Supplies. Hereupon our late Sovereign, that is with God, to the very time of his recovering Heaven, had no other Object of his Conſultations, Reſolutions, and Actions, than the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> The Foreign Treaties and Alliances,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49492:124"/>the Supply of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> the Forces under the Conduct of Count <hi>Mansfield,</hi> the Reparation of the Forces in <hi>England,</hi> the Troops ſent over into <hi>Ireland,</hi> laſtly, this great, and (by God's Aſſiſtance) invincible Fleet, and Navy, though they ſhew like ſo many Lines ſcattered, and divided in the Circumference, yet do they meet and unite themſelves in the Recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as in the Center that bears, and ſupports them all. Theſe great Deſigns the Holy Ghoſt, I hope, hath inſpir'd into you, you to the King our Sovereign, he and you to the King his Father. He before his Death had ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and prepared, as the King our Maſter finds himſelf ſo wrapped, and engaged in the Enterprize, as it fares with his Heroical Heart, as with that <hi>Pompey, Neceſſe eſt ut eam, non ut vivam.</hi> He would more willingly go on to his Grave (which God of his Goodneſs will not permit) than not go onward with this brave Deſign. Now all your Subſidies, and Fifteens: and fully (to ſpeak in meaſure and compaſs) as much more of the Means of the Crown being ſpent in the Preparation, forward the Action cannot move without a new Support, and Supply; which is the Subſtance of all which his Majeſty hath now recommended unto you.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The firſt Circumſtance remembred unto you, is that of Time. A moſt preſſing, and important Circumſtance, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as <hi>Sophocles </hi> calls it, the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of all our Actions. For as <hi>Dion Caſſius </hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib. 11. Non rebus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora, ſed res temporibus inſerviunt, </hi> Actions do not govern Times, but Times govern Actions, be they never ſo weighty. And as <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſays wiſely, <hi>Plaerumque ſera pro nullis ſunt, </hi> That Supply, which comes too late, proves many times no ſupply at all. His Majeſty knows very well that you are wiſe, and provident to obſerves Times and Seaſons. You cannot but obſerve, that Europe ſtands this day like the Pool of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda,</hi> the Waters are ſtirred every where; and we hope by a good Angel. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of<hi>England,</hi> which hath languiſhed for theſe late Years, ſtands at the brink, and now, or not in haſte, is to be healed, and repaired. His Majeſty therefore deſires you to conceive, that this Meeting in this Seſſion is but as a Meeting in a General's Tent, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation in the heat of an Action, which will endure no long Debate. He expects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you will be pleaſed to beſtow this Seſſion upon him, or rather upon this Action, and to haſten for that Cauſe. And his Majeſty will appoint the next as ſoon, and as long, as you pleaſe, for yours, and our own home Affairs. This much concerning Time: The ſecond Circumſtance is for the Manner, which looks upon the Time, as the Time doth upon the Action. For if the manner of gathering this Supply ſhould prove heavy, and ſlow, Time, as <hi>Calliſtratus</hi> in his Statutes ſets him forth, hath <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a Pair of Wings at his Feet, and will quite out-run it. If therefore, in your own Judgments, and Reſolution, you ſhall find the uſual way, and manner of Supplies by Subſidy to be too ſlow, and backward for theſe preſent, and undelayable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, his Majeſty, (no friend to Innovation, <hi>Etiam cum illi neceſſitas lenocinetur,</hi> not now when neceſſity might ſeem to priviledge the ſame) doth rather deſire to hear, and to receive from you, then to project, and propound unto you the manner of ſupplying this preſent Action. This is the ſecond Circumſtance: The Laſt is the End, and the Iſſue of the Action, which hath no meaner Conſequence, than the Fame, and Reputation of our ſweet, and gracious Sovereign, for many Years after. For as <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> that brave King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Ipſa initia plantare debent Principis nominis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam,</hi> as a King ſows his Reputation in his firſt Actions, ſo ſhall he reap his Harveſt of Glory in the Progreſs of his Life, And therefore I muſt ſay of our gracious Maſter, as the Orator ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Haec actio illi aures hominum, haec famae januam pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefaciet.</hi> His Majeſty at this time puts his Fame, and Reputation (that is all that he hath of a King: For what is a King without theſe?) very much upon your Love and Affections. And this, not as <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon his Army at all Adventures, with a <hi>Jacta eſt alea,</hi> a Mum-chance, a caſt of a Dye, but with the greateſt Confidence, and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that ever was plac'd by a loving King, on a moſt loving and indulgent People. Witneſs that Poſie of his in his new ſtamp'd Coin, not to be engraven, as it is, in Silver or Gold, but in the ſolid Subſtance of Loyal Hearts, <hi>Amor civium regis munimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> ſhewing that he cares little for other Forts, being ſo well aſſured of the Love of his People. And therefore as in Nature, <hi>Rex &amp; ſubditus,</hi> the King and the People are proper Relatives, and conſequently <hi>ſimul naturâ,</hi> of one and the ſame Date and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence: So doth his Majeſty little doubt, that as ſoon as himſelf ſhall be known in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope to be an actual King, you alſo ſhall be known by advancing his, nay your Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, to be a valiant, faithful, and obedient People. And now you are directed to chooſe your Speaker, and preſent him to his Majeſty.</p>

St. <hi>Paul</hi> was called <hi>Mercurius</hi> by the <hi>Lycao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> becauſe he was the chief Speaker, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.12. But to whom ſhall I liken you? Truly to nothing but to yourſelf; who have ſpoken more too learnedly, and pithily; the manner whereof hath confuted the Matter: and your Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick hath ſpoil'd your Logick. For no Man that hath heard you ſpeak, can believe your unfitneſs to be a Speaker. His Majeſty therefore doth applaud and confirm your Election, and commands me to return an Anſwer to ſome parts of that you have delivered. Which, though it was (as all great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Bodies are obſerv'd to be) round, and ſphaerical in the Compoſition, without a nook, or a corner for a Man to lay hold upon, yet as ſome late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians have born us in hand, that they can find <hi>Quadraturam circ uli,</hi> ſome corners in a Circle, ſo for Method, and Memory's ſake, <hi>Aut inveniam, aut faciam,</hi> where I do not find, you muſt give me leave to make ſome parts, and to run them over briefly, diſtinctly, and orderly. You have ſaid ſomewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelf; ſomewhat concerning the laſt Parliament, ſomewhat of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus motor,</hi> and Divine Intelligence which enliv'd the ſame: ſomewhat of his Majeſty's Entrance upon his Government, and that in five ſeveral Reſpects.

Fourthly in reſpect of our Hopes of a rare and religious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

Somewhat alſo you have ſaid of our Religion, as much recommended unto the King, and much proſperous and profitable to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Somewhat of the ancient Common-Law: ſomewhat of cheriſhing our Friends abroad: Somewhat of abating our Foes at home: Somewhat of the Four Petitions preſented to all Kings, Immunity of Perſons, Liberty of Speech, readineſs of Acceſs, and benign Interpretation, the four corner Stones, which bear up the Structure of the Houſe of Parliament.

                              <p n="11">11. Firſt for your ſelf you ſay little, but you do much in yielding thus to his Majeſty's Pleaſure. You offer'd a Sacrifice before, the Sacrifice of your Lips, an excuſe from this Service: and that was refuſed. Now you offer up O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that is amply accepted. For Obedience is better than Sacrifice. <hi>Quod felix fauſtumque ſit,</hi> a moſt happy Concatenation to open a Parliament, when the Hearts of the People are in the Hands of the King, and the Heart of the King in the Hand of God. Secondly, for the laſt Parliament it was happy indeed: ſo accompted by our late, ſo eſteemed by our preſent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, ſo denominated by the Effects which it produced. For therein (as you well obſerve) thoſe <hi>male-ſida foedera,</hi> and unfaithful Treatiſes were diſſolv'd, the King and his People indiſſolubly united, the Flowers of the Crown a little pruned, but with the Love of the Subjects better ſcented and perfumed: Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not more Bills of Grace, yet ſurely more Bills from pure Grace paſſed, and were enacted, than in that Seſſion of <hi>Magna Charta: Gratia enim non eſt gratia, ſi non ſit gratis data.</hi> And ſurely as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaid of <hi>Nerva, Debebatur maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo operi haec veneratio, ut noviſſimum ſit, autorque ejus ſtatim conſecraretur</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Prince, who was now ready to be Sainted in Heaven, to cloſe in that manner his Government here on Earth. For I could never learn, in all my Reading, any other way for King or Subject than this one, by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace to paſs along to the Kingdom of Glory. Thirdly for the part the King our Maſter bore in the late Parliament, ſurely he was <hi>Actus primus,</hi> the very proper Soul of that Politick Body, <hi>Tota in toto, &amp; tota in quâlibet parte,</hi> now in the Committees as in the Members, by and by with the Lords as in the Heart, anon with the King his Father as in the Head of the Body, and every where the principal Author of Life, Motion, and Reſolution. So that we may
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49492:125"/>ſay to our now Sovereign, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did by their Orator to the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> that he is no ſtranger to our Aſſembly, <hi>Meminit quae optare. quae ſit queri ſolitus,</hi> he cannot forget the Deſires of the Commons, nor the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>iſhes of the upper Houſe of Parliament. Fourthly your five Circumſtances (for ſo I number them) of his Majeſty's Entrance into his Reign are very well noted, and obſerv'd. 1. That he begins it with a Parliament. It is a ſign indeed of his Love to that way. Thoſe Actions of Men are moſt pure, and ſincere, <hi>Quae ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendi non habent tempus,</hi> that are done in ſuch haſte, as admits no Fiction. His Majeſty was ſcarce proclaimed, when the Writs went out: and before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of his Coronation, behold him preſent in the midſt of his People. 2. That he comes into it with the Blood of Nobles. Yes, Mr. <hi>Speaker, Deus est in utroque parente.</hi> No King in Europe, that breaths this day, can ſhew ſo fair, and ſo Royal a Pedigree. 3. That by his Succeſſion he hath ſweetned much our loſs of his Father. A great, and a glorious Act indeed. And ſuch an act, as I will be bold to ſay in his Majeſty's hearing, could never have been done by any King, not by himſelf, had he been the Son of his Body only, and not withal of his Mind, and Vertues. Herein indeed he equals his Father, <hi>Neque enim de Caeſaris actis—Ullum majus opus, quàm quòd Pater extitit hujus.</hi> 4. For our hopes they have good cauſe (God make us thankful to him for the ſame) to ſore high, and to expect a King, that ſhall exceed <hi>Hezekias</hi> in Policy of State (for our Maſter, I hope, will never diſcover the Secrets of his Dominion to Foreigners, and Strangers) and equal him, at the leaſt, in the Advancement of Religion. You heard his Profeſſion the laſt day. His God above him, his People under him, his Heart within him, and his Kindred about him muſt enflame his Zeal to this true Religion, <hi>Et pater Aeneas, &amp; avunculus excitat Hector.</hi> Laſtly, for his great delivery by Sea and Land, which ſo filled our Mouths with Laughter, and our Tongues with Joy, it ſhew'd him betimes a Child of King <hi>James,</hi> and withal a Child of God, and being ſo, <hi>Nolite tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> no Evil might touch him. As God was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo he was, and will be with him, <hi>non deſeret, aut derelinquet,</hi> he will never fail him, nor forſake him; To the which Prayer all we his repreſentative Kingdom will never fail to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="12">12. What you ſaid of the true Religion is moſt apparently true, that it hath been very piouſly charged upon our King, and hitherto full of Bleſſings upon our Kingdom. For the firſt his Majeſty well remembers (what I ill forgot in another occaſion) that the laſt Bleſſing of all his Father gave him (and I think upon a Motion of mine) was with a Recommendation of his Religion, and of his People to his ſpecial Care, Love, and Protection. And I nothing doubt but that Bleſſing ſhall ſo bleſs him, that he ſhall ſee <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in Proſperity all his Life long. And for the effect of our Religion, it hath hitherto produced in this Kingdom a very Kingdom of Heaven, not only after this Life, but even in this Life, for the ſpace of ſixty Seven Years, wherein it hath been moſt conſtantly profeſſed. All that time Peace hath been within our Walls, and plenteouſneſs within our Palaces. <hi>Non fecit ſic omni nationi,</hi> God hath not dealt ſo with many, nor with any Nation in Europe, that I know, or read of. Sixthly, what you recommended to the King concerning the Laws of the Land, the King hath already in private, and doth now in publick recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to his Judges, and by them to the Profeſſors, and Students of the Laws, to wit, that they would ſpend their time, as their Fore-fathers did, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Common-Laws of the Kingdom, and not altogether, as the Complaint hath been of late, in Statutes, new Caſes, and modern Abridgments. In the former Studies you meet with Reaſon created by God, in the latter with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion only invented by Men. Here you find peradventure ſome ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, but upon weak Grounds, and Premiſes: there you learn ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that can never produce a weak Concluſion. In a word, to borrow the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> there like <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> you Court <hi>Penelope</hi> herſelf; here, like the fooliſh Wooers, but her Hand-maids only. Seventhly, that juſt Reſentment you expreſs of the Diſhonour of our Nation, in that hoſtile Acquiſition, and Detenſion of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> you cannot imagine, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> how much it contents his moſt Excellent Majeſty. Now he finds indeed his People to be lively Members of this Politick Body, becauſe they ſympathize ſo ſeelingly with the grievous Pains, and Troubles of their Head. And ſurely he is no true Part, but an Excreſcency, or dead Fleſh upon the outſide of the State, that is not ſenſible of his Majeſty's Sufferings in thoſe Affairs. God forbid, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49492:125"/>all theſe Profeſſions, this Kingdom ſhould prove to a People ſo allied, either a <hi>Meroz,</hi> as you term it, for Inhumanity, or an <hi>Aegypt</hi> for Infidelity, or a whit inferior to <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf to aid, and relieve them. You heard the full Meaſure of the King's Reſolution the laſt day, <hi>Ire oportet, vivere non oportet;</hi> He doth not deſire to live otherwiſe than in Glory, and Reputation. And ſo he cannot live, you know it well enough, till ſomewhat be vigorouſly effected in that great buſineſs of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> Eightly, for the abandoning of thoſe Sons of <hi>Bichri,</hi> the Prieſt and Jeſuits, his Majeſty returns you this Anſwer. As he doth approve your Zeal, and Devotion herein, and acknowledgeth that of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to be true, <hi>Quod in religionem committitur, in omnium vertitur injuriam,</hi> that the meaneſt Subject in this Kingdom hath a great right, and Intereſt in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo being appointed by, and under God, <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabulae,</hi> the Guardian, and Keeper of both the Tables, he deſires you to truſt him (whoſe Zeal was never yet queſtioned, or ſuſpected) with the ways, and means to propagate the ſame, Yet in this Petition of yours his moſt Excellent Majeſty doth abſolutely grant the Effect, and the Matter, that is to be moſt careful of our Religion, or (which you more deſire) to improve, and better the Form, and Manner. But as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of God himſelf, <hi>Non tribuit aliquando quod volumus, ut quod malimus attribuat.</hi> Laſtly, for your four ordinary Petitions, for Immunity of Perſons, liberty of Speech, readineſs of Acceſs, benign Interpretation, his moſt Excellent Majeſty grants them all, and will have them limited by no other bounds, than your own Wiſdom, Modeſty, and good Diſcrietion. So his Majeſty bids <hi>God Speed the Plow.</hi>

                  <p n="13">13. I look upon him that ſpake ſo well for the King two days together, as <hi>Antiquarius</hi> did upon the L. <hi>Picus Mirandula, Ratio, &amp; oratio cum ipſo ex côdem utero natae videantur,</hi> Ep. 279. Here's ſtrong Mettle, and a keen Edge, able to cleave the hardeſt Knot. Here's Reaſon to convince Judgment, with ſtore of Eloquence to delight the Affections. Which could not be paſt over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this cenſure: for it is an ill thrift, to be parſimonious in the praiſe of that which is very good. The King repoſed much upon the Succeſs of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe his Mind was ſo well deliver'd, and ſo ſtrongly put on. The Cauſe of the War was made the Kingdoms: The Counſel that began it was the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and were they not bound to find the Succours? As our Poet Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſays upon Prince <hi>Henry</hi>'s Barriers, <hi>He doth but ſcourge himſelf his Sword that draws. Without a Purſe, a Counſel, and a Cauſe.</hi> But the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all Ages, I believe, will not ſhew a Man, in whom Vertue was more perpetually unfortunate, than in this King. The Influence of thoſe ill Stars, that reigned over all his Reign, began thus ſoon. The Parliament was told, as if a Dictator had been nominated for this War, that all muſt be conſulted and executed together; that the preſent Sacrifice muſt be eaten in haſte, like the Lord's firſt Paſſover: for in that juncture ſlow help was no help. Yet in five Weeks (ſo long they ſat at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) there was not an Arrow to any purpoſe ſhot towards that Mark. Theſe were they that thruſt his Majeſty upon a War, to the mortifying of his Father's part: and now his Enemies were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd with the Alarum, they let him ſhift for himſelf. Being told enough that there muſt be Gold, as well as Iron to play this Game, and that a good Purſe made a good Army, they gave him ſuch diſcouragement, that they dropt no more than two Mites into the <hi>Corban.</hi> An incredible diſproportion between what was found, and what was lookt for: and ſuitable to a Paſſage in an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Comedy, where a Gueſt complains of his ill Entertainment at a Miſer's Table, that there was not enough to make a good Supper, nor ſcarce enough to make a good Salad.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Yet the hardeſt Remedy had been the beſt Patience. For by the ſecond Week in <hi>July</hi> the Plague was in its rage about <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The Members of both Houſes were half ſlunk home, and they that ſtaid it out, wiſht every hour the Seſſion were ended. The King was in a mervellous ſtrait: neither knew how to hold them, nor to let them go. His mind was much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, to try them, though not there, yet ſome where elſe, for an augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Supply. Whoſe excuſe was the ſame, which the Queen of <hi>Carthage</hi> made to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> Lib. 1. Aen. <hi>Res dura, &amp; novitas regni me talia cogunt —Moliri.</hi> His Majeſty thought change of Air would do good, and propoſed to ſome of his Council at <hi>Hampton-Court, July</hi> 10. to adjourn to <hi>Oxford</hi> againſt the firſt of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> A Propoſition mainly favour'd by the Lord-Duke, ſo that he grinn'd at the Lord-Keeper, all the while he diſſwaded it. But take away liberty from Speech,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49492:126"/>and take away Bitterneſs from Wormwood, nay take away Spirit from Wine. Yet he went on, and ſpake to theſe two Heads, that it was not another place, but another time that muſt ſpeed the Work. Firſt, the Infection of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence had overſpread the whole Land: that no Man, that travell'd from his own home, knew where to lodge in ſafety: that the Lords and Gentlemen would be ſo diſtaſted, to be carried abroad in ſuch a Mortal time, that it is likely, when they came together, they would Vote out of diſcontent, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: that his Majeſty was ill counſell'd to give Offences, though ſmall ones, in the bud of his Reign, <hi>Quae nulli magis evitandae ſunt, quàm juveni &amp; Principi, cujus gratia cum aetate debet adoleſcere,</hi> as <hi>Symmachus,</hi> Lib. 1. Ep. writes to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> Secondly, the Parliament hath given two Subſidies at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> though they remove to <hi>Oxford</hi> it is yet the ſame Seſſion: and if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it is not the uſe of the Houſe to give twice in a Seſſion, (though I wiſh heartily they would) yet how ſhall we plead them out of their Cuſtom, if they be ſo ſtiff to maintain it? It is not fit for the Reputation of the King, to fall upon a probable hazard of a denial. The Duke, who had heard this with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, ſaid, <hi>That publick Neceſſity might ſway more than one Man's Jealouſie.</hi> Hereupon the Keeper beſought that he might commit a few words to the King's Ear in private: which was granted. And he acquainted his Majeſty, <hi>That the Lord-Duke had Enemies in the Houſe of Commons, who had contrived Complaints, had made them ready to be preferr'd, and would ſpend the time at</hi> Oxford <hi>about them. And what folly it were to continue a Seſſion, that had no other aim, but to bring the Duke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage? But if your Majeſty think that this is like a Hectick, quickly known, but hardly cur'd; My humble Motion is, that this Malady, or Malice, call it which you will, may ſleep till after</hi> Chriſtmas. <hi>There is no time loſt in whetting the Sythe well. For I hope to give ſuch account by that time, by undertaking with the chief Sticklers, that they ſhall ſuperſede from their Bitterneſs againſt your great Servant, and that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to your weighty Councils ſhall be made ſmooth, and peaceable.</hi> And why do you conceal this from <hi>Buckingham, ſays the King? Good Lord Sir,</hi> ſays the Keeper, <hi>fain I would begin at that end, but he will not hear me with moderation. Which was rightly foreſeen.</hi> Eraſmus <hi>in an Epiſtle to one</hi> Gonel <hi>asks, How a good turn can be worſe beſtowed than upon ungrateful Men?</hi> Yes, <hi>ſays he,</hi> Magis perit quod praeſtatur non intelligentibus. <hi>'Tis worſe placed upon them, that will not underſtand. Becauſe it was the miſhap of this Man to give the firſt notice of that Storm that was a gathering, the Duke as in defiance, bid him and his Confederates do their worſt, and beſought that the Parliament might be continued, to confront that Faction; though he lookt upon himſelf in that innocency, that he preſum'd they durſt not queſtion him.</hi> Here began the Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of the Lord-Keeper; miſtruſted to ſet that Wheel a going, whoſe Motion he diſcover'd, and offer'd to put a Spoke into it. But Truth faileth: <hi>And he that departeth from Evil maketh himſelf a Prey,</hi> Iſa. 59.15. And here began the Troubles of mighty <hi>Buckingham:</hi> who would not gain ſix Months time, which might have made Miſchiefs mellow, and rot. But to ſhew the Greatneſs of his Power, he made haſte to deſtroy himſelf: being in one Character too like to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, <hi>Nunquam ab eo, ad quod ingenio feroci impellebatur; rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum putavit.</hi> He would never retreat from that, to which the Violence of his Paſſions hurried him.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. He had his Will, and <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>1st.</hi> the Seſſion continued at <hi>Oxford.</hi> Of which place it may be ſaid as <hi>Caſſiodor</hi> did of <hi>Athens, Aëris puritate peruncta luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſimos ſenſus ad contemplationem felici largitate praeparavit.</hi> But it appears by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it hath been more renown'd for good Wits, than for good Parliaments. The Commons ſat in the Divinity-School, who for the moſt part begin with a Grievance about increaſe of Popery. And on the firſt Morning, no ſooner had the <hi>Speaker</hi> taken his place, but a Weſtern Knight enlargeth the Senſe of his Sorrow, that he had ſeen a Pardon for ſix Prieſts, bearing Teſt, <hi>July</hi> 12. Whereas, but the day before it, when they were to part from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Lord-Keeper had promis'd in the King's Name before them all, that the Rigor of the Laws againſt Prieſts ſhould not be deluded. Many of the Members were ſore offended, and veyed who ſhould blame it moſt. What! their Hopes blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Night? What the King's Promiſe ſo early broken? <hi>Nunquam major ſpes eſt quàm in bonorum Principum ſponſione,</hi> Symmachus, Ep. <hi>to</hi> Theodoſ. Lib. 1. But for a Lord-Keeper that brought the King's Meſſage, and knew it beſt, and for a Biſhop to ſet the Seal to ſuch a Warrant, for him to do that wrong to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it was enormous. But for his part he was ſecure enough. Indeed it was a Pit-fall ſet to cruſh him, but it fell upon another. God had given him Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49492:126"/>to know the Violence of Winds, and the Reaſonings of Men, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 7.20. The Warrant was twice brought to him, but he would not paſs it. Mr. <hi>Bembo,</hi> a Servant to the Clerk of the Crown, confeſt before the Houſe, that he brought the Writ to be ſealed, but it was ſtopt. Mr. <hi>Devike,</hi> Servant to Sir <hi>Edward Conway,</hi> confeſt he brought it from his Maſter: but it could not ſpeed. It was my Lord <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s hard Hap, to move the King to command the Warrant to be Sealed in his ſight at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> the <hi>Sunday</hi> following: which being evidenced, the Vote of the Commons turn'd about to clear the Keeper, and to commend him: which did him hurt at <hi>Woodſtock</hi> (the Court was there) to pleaſe the Parliament, which had not pleas'd the King. An Error like to that of <hi>Adrians</hi> in <hi>Spartianus, Non admiſit Terentium Gentianum: eſt eò vehementiùs, quod à Senatu diligi eum videret.</hi> But the Commons, while they were in heat, ask'd a Conference with the Lords Afternoon in <hi>Chriſt's-Church-Hall:</hi> where Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> opened the Complaint ſharply againſt Secretary <hi>Conway:</hi> and like an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor did ſlide away with a ſhort Animadverſion upon the Duke. It was not ſo well for his Grace, that the noiſe of the Grievance had entred into both Houſes. <hi>Arcus cum ſunt duplices pluviam nuntiant,</hi> ſays <hi>Pliny, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>N. H.</hi> c. 59. If our Rain-bow multiply another by its Reflection, it prognoſticks a Shower. And the Storm burſt out in the lower Region: when he was rather declam'd againſt, as I would call it, than accus'd, becauſe the Gentlemen that did proſecute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd themſelves in generals. The moſt upon which inſiſtance was made, was, that he held the moſt, and the moſt important Offices of Truſt, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by Sea and Land. Though it was fooliſh and ſuperſtitious in the Heathen <hi>Romans,</hi> to think it was not for the Majeſty of their Common-wealth to ſerve but one God, <hi>Majeſtatem imperii non decuiſſe, ut unus tantùm Deus colatur,</hi> Tull. Orat. pro Flacco: Yet it were to be deſir'd, if it might be dutifully obtain'd, that one Subject ſhould not poſſeſs all thoſe Places, which require the Sufficiency of many to diſcharge them. Much to this purpoſe is that of the Lord <hi>Herbert, Harry.</hi> 8. p. 318. That it was a great Error, that ſuch a multitude of Offices was inveſted in <hi>Woolſey:</hi> as it drew Envy upon the Cardinal, ſo it derogated not a little from the Regal Authority, while one Man alone ſeems to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all. The King may be ſatisfied, to ſettle the Choice of his high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in one Minion: ſo will never the People. And the Advanced is ſure to be ſhaken for his height, and to be malign'd for over-dropping. He that ſees a Stone-wall ſwelling, looks every day when it will fall. And one Stalk is not ſtrong enough, to hold a cluſter of Titles hanging at it. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> hath a Note upon the firſt Book of <hi>Solinus, That if a Man grow ſo faſt, that it exceeds the uſual way of Nature, he will fall into ſickneſs.</hi> His Inſtance is in the Son of <hi>Euthymenes,</hi> that grew three Cubits in three Years, <hi>Et immoderatis aegritudinum ſuppliciis compenſaſſe praecipitem incrementi celeritatem.</hi> But what Grandee will believe this?

Numbers there were, ſome Friends, ſome Flatterers, that brought Fuel to the Fire to enflame the Duke againſt theſe Dealings. The Lord-Keeper was not ſought to. Yet came, and offer'd himſelf
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49492:127"/>to confer about it. And certainly all that knew him would ſay, no Man could pluck the Graſs better, to know where the Wind ſat: no Man could ſpie ſooner from whence a Miſchief did riſe. I'll begin thus:</p>

The Sword is the Cauſe of a Wound: but the Buckler is in fault, if it do not defend the Body, You have brought the Two Houſes hither, my Lord, againſt my Counſel. My Suſpicion is confirm'd, that your Grace would ſuffer for it. What's now to be done? but wind up a Seſſion quickly. The occaſion is for you; becauſe two Colledges in the Univerſity, and eight Houſes in the City are viſited with the Plague. Let the Members be promis'd fairly and friendly, that they ſhall meet again after</hi> Chriſtmas. <hi>Requite their Injuries done unto you with benefits, and not revenge. For no Man, that is wiſe, will ſhew himſelf angry with the People of</hi> England. <hi>I have more to ſay, but no more than I have ſaid to your Grace above a Year paſt at</hi> White-hall. <hi>Confer one or two of your great Places upon your faſteſt Friends: ſo ſhall you go leſs in Envy, and not leſs in Power.

And once more he was bold to wreſtle with this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate in high Favour, before he fell. <hi>The Commons of this Parliament was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd at</hi> Woodſtock <hi>for ſpiteful, and ſeditious: therefore not fit to continue, but to be diſſolv'd.</hi> Which Reſolution being brought to the Clerk of the Crown, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them on the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> the Keeper did never ſo beſtir him ſince he was born, as to turn the Tide, with Reaſons, with Supplications, with Tears, imploring his Majeſty to remember a time, when, in his hearing, his bleſſed Father had charg'd him to call Parliaments often, and continue them, though their raſhneſs ſometimes did offend him; that in his own Experience, he never got good by falling out with them. <hi>But chiefly Sir,</hi> ſays he, <hi>let it never be ſaid, that you have not kept good Correſpondence with your firſt Parliament. Do not diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate ſo much unkindneſs through all the Counties, and Boroughs of your Realm. The Love of the People is the Palladium of your Crown. Continue this Aſſembly to another Seſſion, and expect alteration for the better. If you do not ſo, the next ſwarm will come out of the ſame Hive.</hi> To this the Lords of the Council did almoſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; but it wanted <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Suffrage: who was ſecure that the King's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would follow him againſt all the Table. So this firſt Parliament was blaſted, <hi>Et radicis vitium in fructibus naſcentibus oſtenditur.</hi> The Root fail'd, and the Fruit was unſavory in all the Branches that grew up after it. I would the Builders had laid a better corner Stone: then the Lord had not ſmote the great Houſe with Breaches, and the little Houſe with Clefts, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.11. Yet I would the King's Aequanimity had ſuffered it to ſtand, that Concord might have cemented the Hearts of all the Nation to his Government. It is a Trivial, but a dangerous Overſight,

                              <head>REASONS to ſatisfie your moſt excellent Majeſty concerning my Carriage all this laſt Parliament.</head>
                              <p n="18">18. Firſt negatively, That I did nothing diſſerviceably to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, or the Duke. For firſt, I never ſpake at <hi>Oxford</hi> with any of the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Men, as was untruly ſuggeſted to your Majeſty, excepting once with <hi>Philips,</hi> with the Privity, and for the Service of the Duke. And with <hi>Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> at his firſt coming to Town, and before his coming to the Houſe. Who promiſed (and I do verily believe he perform'd it) to carry himſelf advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly to your Majeſty's Service, and not to joyn with any that ſhould ſly upon my Lord Duke. The reſt are all Strangers to me: and I never ſpake with any one of them concerning any Parliamentary matters. Secondly, I did croſs the popular way, more than any of the Council; which I durſt not have done, if I had intended to run along with them. 1. In adviſing your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, knowing how you were engaged to the Queen, to reſerve to yourſelf the Execution of the Laws againſt Recuſants, at leaſt-wiſe for a time, as at <hi>Rycott.</hi> 2. In maintaining this Advice afterward before the Council at <hi>Oxford.</hi> 3. In lingring and ſtaying the Bill againſt Recuſants. 4. In direct Oppoſition to the Lord <hi>Saye,</hi> in ſtaying the Bill of Tonnage and Poundage, which was the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Active part in the Houſe of Commons. Had I intended to run any way with the People, I had been a Mad-man to have appear'd in any of theſe. Affirmatively, I offer'd my poor Service to your Majeſty, for the executing of any Directions, ſhould be given me in private. Firſt, I waited upon your Majeſty three or four times before your Journey to <hi>Dover,</hi> to know if you would give me any private Directions, but received none. 2. I waited upon your Majeſty and the Duke three ſeveral times while the Parliament ſat at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and my Anſwer was ſtill, you had nothing to ſay to me. 3. I waited to know if your Majeſty had ought to command me privately at <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> at <hi>Biſſam,</hi> at <hi>Ricott</hi> towards the <hi>Oxford</hi> Sitting; and was ever anſwer'd as before. 4. I did the like to my Lord-Duke at <hi>Oxford,</hi> deſiring his Lordſhip to ſend me his Commands by any truſty Servant, and I would ſerve him to the utmoſt of my Power from time to time. His Grace ſaid he would ſend, but never ſent to me. So that if I had any Power in either Houſe (I had much the leſs at this time by reaſon of the Paucity of the Lawyers, who were in the Circuit) what uſe could I make of it without Directions? And to tell the plain truth, I durſt do nothing for fear of offending the Duke, otherwiſe than by Direction. Only 'tis known, that they that were for giving of Subſidies, repaired to me as often as to any other Lord, who can witneſs of my Care, both in Matters of Subſidies, and the Buſineſs of my Lord-Duke. Rationally it was unſafe for me to ſtickle at this time without Countenance and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by, and from your excellent Majeſty. Firſt your Majeſty knoweth, I was threatned before your Majeſty to be complained of in Parliament, on the third Day of your Reign. And though your Majeſty moſt graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to do me Juſtice therein: Yet was I left under that Minacy, and the Minacer, for ought I know, left to his courſe againſt me. 2. My Lord-Duke confeſt he knew the Complaints, and Complainants; and gave me leave to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his Grace (which indeed I had cauſe to do) if within three days, and three days he ſhould not acquaint me with the Names of the Parties. Which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49492:128"/>to know, not to expoſtulate, but to watch, and provide to defend my innocency. His Grace failed me in his promiſe herein. I employed Sir <hi>Charles Glemham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sackvile Crowe</hi> to preſs him for an Anſwer; which was ſuch, as they durſt not in modeſty return unto me. 3. Sir <hi>Francis Seymore</hi> (a Knight whom I know not by ſight) told many of that Houſe, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it unto me, that upon his firſt coming to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he was dealt with by a Creature of my Lord-Dukes (whom I can name) to ſet upon the Lord-Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and they ſhould be backed by the greateſt Men in the Kingdom. Who gave this Anſwer, <hi>That he found nothing againſt the Lord-Keeper, but the Malice of thoſe great Men.</hi> 4. Sir <hi>John Eliot,</hi> the only Member that began to thruſt in a Complaint againſt me: the Lord-Viſcount <hi>Saye,</hi> who took upon him to name Sir <hi>Thomas Crew</hi> to ſucceed in my Place: Sir <hi>William Stroud,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nathanael Rich,</hi> whom my Friends moſt noted to malice me, were never out of my Lord-Duke's Chamber, and Boſom. 5. Noble-men of good Place, and near your Majeſty, gave me often intelligence, that his Grace's Agents ſtirred all their Powers to ſet the Commons upon me. 6. I told the Lord-Duke in my Garden, that having been much reprehended by your Majeſty, and his Grace in the Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi>'s Tryal, for thanking the laſt King at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to protect his Servants, and great Officers againſt the People and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, I durſt not be ſo active, and ſtirring by my Friends in that Houſe, as otherwiſe I ſhould be, unleſs your Majeſty, by his Grace's means, would be pleas'd to encourage me with your Royal Promiſe, to defend and protect me in your Service. If I might hear your Majeſty ſay ſo much, I would venture then my Credit, and my Life, to manage what ſhould be entruſted to me to the uttermoſt. After which he never brought me to your Majeſty, nor any Meſſage from you. Standing therefore upon theſe doubtful terms, unemploy'd in the Duties of my Place (which were now aſſign'd over to my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and Sir <hi>J. Cooke</hi>) and left out of all Committees among the Lords of the Council (which I know was never done by the direction of your Majeſty, who ever conceiv'd of me far above my Merit) and conſequently fallen much in the Power, and Reputation due to my place, I durſt not at this time, with any Safety, buſie my ſelf in the Houſe of Commons, with any other than that meaſure of Zeal, which was expreſt by the reſt of the Lords of the Privy-Council. Gracious and dread Sovereign, if this be not enough to clear me, let me periſh.</p>

                  <p n="19">19. The King was a Judge of Reaſon, and of Righteouſneſs, and found ſo much in that Paper, that he diſmiſt him that preſented it graciouſly for that time, his Deſtiny being removed two Months further off, though it was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urg'd, not to delay it for a day. But in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s words, <hi>Nemo diu tutus eſt periculo proximus.</hi> About a Fortnight after, at <hi>Holdbery</hi> in <hi>New-forreſt,</hi> the Duke unfaſt'ned him utterly from the good Opinion of his Majeſty, and at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in the midſt of <hi>September,</hi> obtain'd an irrevocable Sentence to deprive him of his Office. If the Queen could have ſtopt this Anger, he had not been remov'd: with whom he had no little Favour, by the Credit he had got with the chief Servants of her Nation, and by a Speech which took her Majeſty very much, which he made unto her in <hi>May,</hi> upon her coming to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and in ſuch <hi>French</hi> as he had ſtudied, when he preſented his Brethren the Biſhops, and their Homage to her Majeſty. His Friends of that Nation ſhew'd themſelves ſo far, that <hi>Pere Berule,</hi> the Queen's Confeſſor, and not long after a Cardinal, was the firſt that advertis'd him, how my Lord-Duke had lifted him out of his Seat. 'Tis cuſtom to Toll a little before a Paſſing-bell ring out: and that ſhall be done in a Moral ſtrode; as <hi>Chaucer</hi> calls it. Such as would know the true Impulſion unto this Change, ſhall err, if they draw it from any thing, but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Negotiation. Not as if the Lord-Keeper had done any one, much leſs many ill Services, to the Duke, as one miſtakes. For I take the Obſervator to be ſo juſt, that he would have done as much himſelf, if he had been in place. King <hi>James</hi> was ſick'till that Marriage was conſummated; and died becauſe he committed it to the Skill of an Emperick. The Keeper ſerv'd the King's directions, rather than the croſs ways of the Duke, which was never forgiven. Though the late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had wrought wonders to the King's Content, as it gave him none, this innocent Perſon had receiv'd the Blow, which was aimed at him, before the Parliament ſat. He beſtirr'd him in the former King's Reign, to check the encroaching of the Commons, about impeaching the great Peers, and Officers of the Realm, which the Duke fomented in the Earl of <hi>Middleſex</hi>'s Caſe. Since
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49492:128"/>that Houſe began to be filled with ſome, that were like the turbulent <hi>Athenians,</hi>

There was no Sin, I think, that he hated more, than that Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick violence, which he ſaw was come about, that the People extoll'd them moſt, as it was once in the Days of <hi>Marius,</hi> that endeavour'd to thruſt down the moſt noble <hi>Patricians.</hi> This is the right Abſtract what was, and what was not the Cauſe of this Mutation.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. There were yet other things, that did concur to precipitate his Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. Firſt, My Lord of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s honeſt Servants would ſay, that he gave their Maſter conſtantly the beſt Counſel: but that he was too robuſtious in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. <hi>Vim temperatam Dii quoque provehunt in majus,</hi> Horat. lib. 3. Od. Well, I do not deny it. But the more ſtout in that Point, the more true, and cordial He that loſes ſuch a one, that comes to prop him up, who had rather offend him, than not ſave him, <hi>Navem perforat, in quâ ipſe navigat, Cicer. pro Milone,</hi> he ſinks the Bark, wherein himſelf fails. The <hi>Scythians</hi> were eſteemed barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; but this is wiſe, and civil in them, as <hi>Lucian</hi> reports in his <hi>Toxaris, They have no wealth; but he is counted the richeſt Man, that hath moſt Friends.</hi> And that's a Friend, that will incur Anger, rather than leave his Friend to ſooth himſelf in a Miſchief. It had been well for the Duke, if his bold Friend had perſwaded him to take that Counſel, which <hi>Chriſtopher Thuanus</hi> gave to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> being in great Favour with <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>France, Si poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam ſuam diuturnam cuperet, moderatè eâ uteretur, &amp; in politicá adminiſtratione leges regni conſervaret; alioqui fore ut publicae invidiae impar, Procerum regni, &amp; Nobilitatis contra ſe concitato odio, aliquando ſuccumberet,</hi> Aug. Thua. An. 1568. Secondly, Some of the Lords of the Council were willing to ſpare the Keeper, for that having a mighty ſtanding Wardrobe of Reaſon, likely he bore down that ſide which he oppos'd. Why would not <hi>Plato</hi> endure <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Utopia?</hi> becauſe he was too great a Citizen for his City. And <hi>Ariſtotle. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Polit.</hi> c. 4.

                     </gap>, his main ſtrength at the Oar was above his Fellows, his parts were unequal in <hi>ſupere minence.</hi> Nor did his Majeſty like it well, that he would never give over, till he was Conqueror in the Argument that he held: and he ever held him to be too nimble, and verſatile in his Diſcourſes. For the Taſte of that good King's Mind was much like to his Palate, he never loved Sauce with his Meat; nor Sharpneſs in his Counſels. He deſired to ſee all his way before him, and not to be led through Windings, and Allies. Another King was of that Conceit, ſays, Thua. lib. 11. <hi>Franciſcus magna ingenia ſuſpect a habere coepit.</hi> Thirdly, The blaff that help'd to blow down this Cedar, was the Breath of <hi>Obtreclators,</hi> and Tale bearers. Who are too much about great Men, as it may be ſaid by Alluſion from the 66 <hi>Pſal. v.</hi> 3. After the vulgar <hi>Latin, For the Greatneſs of thy Power ſhall the People be found Lyars unto thee.</hi> Theſe were too thick about the Duke, and cheriſh'd with his Countenance, and Liberality. For Reward not Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and you ſhall be ſure to be rid of them. If any are loth to put Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> in this Number, I muſt either reform their Knowledge, or write againſt mine own. They are yet living that have heard it confeſt by the Lord <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi>'s Mother. And theſe words are in the Manuſcript remembred before, Penn'd by Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot, That the Counteſs of</hi> Buckingham <hi>told the Biſhop of</hi> Lincoln, <hi>that St.</hi> Davids <hi>was the Man that did undermine him with her Son, and would underwork any Man in the World, that himſelf might riſe.</hi> St. <hi>Davids</hi> ſaw no Man in the proſpect of likelihood but this one, to carry the higheſt Miter from him. <hi>Interna crevit Roma Albae ruinis,</hi> as <hi>Livy</hi> ſays. Fourthly, my Lord-Duke was ſoon ſatiated with their Greatneſs, whom he had advanc'd. It was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Mark of thoſe Thirteen Years of his Power to remove Officers. Which was like a ſweeping Floud, that at every Spring-tide takes from one Land, and caſts it upon another. In two Years of King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Williams, Lee, Conway, Suckling, Crow, Walter</hi> had their Top-ſails pull'd down by him: and if Sir <hi>Henry Yelverton</hi> had liv'd, not only Sir <hi>A. Welden</hi> writes it, but common Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour nois'd it, that he had been promoted to the Place of the Lord <hi>Coventry.</hi> Which was very prejudicious to the true Diſcharge of thoſe Dignities. As <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtus</hi> complains in <hi>Tully, Men were ſo ſhort liv'd, that by the time they began to know the World, Death ſnatch'd them out of it:</hi> So a Magiſtrate can yield no great Fruit, that's pluck'd up before he be well rooted. <hi>Antonnius,</hi> call'd the Philoſopher, provided better for that, as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> hath it, as he was wiſe in all his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Still the Plot was buſie againſt the Lord-Keeper, to diſplace him with ſome colour of Charge. And the King being come to <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>September</hi> with a full Court, it came to a <hi>Cataſtrophe.</hi> He that was hunted after, was at harbour at a Houſe of the Lord <hi>Sand</hi>'s in <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> five Miles from <hi>Windſor,</hi> call'd <hi>Foxly.</hi> Where he was ſurely inform'd, that after much ſifting ſpent, after all that ever he did, ſince his high Promotion, the old Matter was renewed, how he ſtirred up thoſe that lifted at the Duke at <hi>Oxford:</hi> which was urg'd with ſtrange, and punctual Confidence; and was the weakeſt, and leaſt grounded Surmiſe, that ever was hammer'd. Therefore it was ſupplied with another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: That at the ſame time and place he had abus'd the King with ill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, adviſing him to vail his abſolute Sovereignty too much, to a ſocial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with his Subjects. Which being divulg'd, got him that was accus'd a ſtrong Gale of popular Favour, did his Majeſty no right and caſt the Duke upon ſuch a Shelf, as no High-tide could bring him off, while he liv'd. The Keeper hearing every day what Cavillations were fomented, and heard, to put him to blame and ſhame, found it in vain to coaſt the Seaſon any longer, to have the Great-Seal tarry with him. Only reſolv'd on the <hi>21ſt.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his way by his Pen, before he went to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> to ſalute the King's Ear with ſoftneſs, and to ſhew, that he did not deſpond, but that he was ready for a Juſtification, if he were call'd to anſwer. Which for all his Labour would hardly be believ'd. For all Treaſure hid in the Ground is the Kings: But how will he find it? So all truth that concerns his Juſtice and Proſperity is his: But how will he know it? This Man is not the firſt that made it true, which <hi>Sidon. Apoll.</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. That it is dangerous ſerving of Kings in a near place: who are compar'd by him to fire, <hi>Qui ſicut paululum à ſe remota illuminat, ita ſatis ſibi admota comburit.</hi> It is a good Element or light and warmth, to thoſe that ſtand aloof, but ſingeth that which comes too near it. Yet nothing venture, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing have. One Arrow muſt be ſhot after another, though both be graſt, and never found again. <hi>In aequo eſt amiſſio rei, &amp; timor amittendi,</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca.</hi> Nay, he loſeth more quiet of Mind, that looks every day to loſe that which he loves, than in the Minute, when he is deprived of it. One ſays, <hi>When the Brunt is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Heart will recover.</hi> Time and long day will mitigate ſad Accidents: 'tis a ſlow Medicine, but a ſure one.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Now let the Letter to his Majeſty be obſerv'd, which was his Harbinger.</p>

And 'twas a notable Shift which came into their Heads, and wrought upon the King's Judgment, as that which had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of Reaſon. Which was thus, that as the Keeper had been complain'd of, ſo he ſhould be charg'd home with his own Words; nay, with his own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But none durſt accuſe him, till he was out of his Greatneſs. Upon the Expiration of that, the Proofs ſhould be brought in: who coming about the firſt Week in <hi>October</hi> to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and hearing this, told ſuch, as were deſired to carry it to the King, and the great Lord, that he would not ſly the Tilt, nor ſtart from any colour of Accuſation. That the World would ſee how prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous it was firſt to puniſh, and then to bring to Judgment. <hi>Multis minatur, qui uni facit injuriam.</hi> The wrong that was done to one Man, would affright all others with that Oppreſſion. What Lord, or Gentleman in <hi>England,</hi> that had Place and Means, would think himſelf ſafe upon the Example of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings? From the hour that the Keeper committed this Meſſage to truſty Friends to deliver it, the <hi>Gorgen</hi>'s Head had a Veil drawn before it, and it never confronted him either at the Council-Table, or in any Court of Juſtice, but was laid ſtill for ever. Yet was not a jot the better for it. The Suſpicion was ſmother'd, and yet liv'd, and wrought as much to his prejudice, as if he had been tried before the Court of <hi>Areopagites,</hi> and convicted by their Verdict. Only this Happineſs did live with him, and doth ſurvive him, that ſuch as have no Intereſt in it, but the diſcovery of Truth, do ſee, it was <hi>Crimen ſine accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore, Sententia ſine Concilio, damnatio ſine defenſione,</hi> Tul. Act. 7. in <hi>Verrem.</hi> He that was degraded without hearing, Tryal, Proof, Witneſs, Judges, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by Calumny, not by Accuſation. For Accuſation admits a fair, and a legal Proceſs: Calumny is believed without a Conteſtation. After this, it was not long before ſome quick Eye eſpied a way to execute the King's Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for diveſting the Party of his honourable Place, but with ſuch Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as would load him with no impeachment of his Service, but barely recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Great-Seal from his Cuſtody, becauſe it was committed to him at firſt upon triennial Truſt, and no longer. Which was no unwonted Revocation, ſays the great, and learned Luminary of Records, Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Gloſſary</hi> upon the word <hi>Cancellarius, Non perpetuus olim fuit honor, ſed triennalis, vel qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driennalis.</hi> This device ſtruck the Tally for all Debts, and Claims: and left the loſer a more light Heart, though he parted with a heavy Purſe. For he

Yet, though nothing was alter'd in him to appearance, when he was doom'd to reſign his Office with ſuch a plauſible Diſmiſſion, pruning away the Circumſtances of it, I cannot ſee how the ſubſtance of the Act could chooſe but diſpleaſe him. For whether it come from a white, or a black Whip, the Wound will be blew. The Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, with which all that remain'd were wound up, were firſt between the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and the Lord-Keeper: Laſtly, with his Majeſty, if they belong, let him skip them, that doth not like them. He that would ſatisfie Poſterity, knows not how to leave them out. And it will be worth the noting, to learn from a wiſe Man, how to manage a broken Fortune. One of the firſt things that <hi>Comines</hi> praiſes in King <hi>Lewis</hi> his Maſter is, <hi>Optimòrationem tenebat ex adverſis rebus eluctandi.</hi> To be fallen into great disfavour, and yet to come off with no blot of Credit, proves him that could do it a great Maſter in State-wiſdom.

                  <p>On the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> came to the Lord-Keeper's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and began thus:

<q>My Lord, His Majeſty, ſome four days ago, gave me a Command to deliver a Meſſage unto you, the which becauſe it was ſharp, and there might be occaſion for change of Councils, I forbore to deliver till this Morning. That is, That his Majeſty underſtanding that his Father, who is with God, had taken a Reſolution, that the Keepers of the Great-Seal of <hi>England</hi> ſhould continue but from three Years to three Years, and approving very well thereof, and reſolved to obſerve the Order during his own Reign, he expects that you ſhould ſurrender up the Seal by <hi>Allhallowtide</hi> next, alledging no other cauſe thereof. And that withal, that having ſo done, you ſhould retire your ſelf to your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſwer.</label>

                     <q>I am his Majeſty's moſt humble Servant and Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, to be commanded by him in all things whatſoever: The Great-Seal is his Majeſty's. And I will be ready to deliver up the ſame to any Man, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhall ſend with his Warrant to require it. And do heartily thank God, and his Majeſty, that his calling for the Seal is upon no other ground.</q>

(No indeed, <hi>ſaid Mr.</hi> Secretary, no other ground that I know.)

<q>Only this laſt Clauſe ſeemeth ſtrange unto me, that I ſhould be reſtrained to my Biſhoprick, or any place elſe. And I humbly appeal to his Majeſty's Grace, and Favour therein. Becauſe it is no fault in me that his Majeſty or his Father, hath made ſuch a Reſolution: Nor do I diſpute againſt it; although the King that dead is continued me in the Place after the three Years ended: and the King that now is deliver'd me the Seal without any Condition, or limitation of Time. And therefore deſerving no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, I humbly deſire to be left to my diſcretion, which I will ſo uſe, as ſhall be no way offenſive to his Majeſty.</q>

                     <label>Lord <hi>Conway.</hi>
                     </label>

                     <q>I conceive it not to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but to mount in effect, that his Majeſty intends not to employ you at the Table, but leaves you free to go to your Biſhoprick.</q>

                     <label>Anſwer.</label>

                     <q>My Lord, I deſire your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Interceſſion for an Explanation of that Point. And I beſeech your Lordſhip to move his Majeſty, that I may attend upon him (conſidering there is no offence laid to my charge) to preſent unto his Majeſty two humble Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nothing concerning this buſineſs in hand, but in general, the one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Reputation, and the other my maintenance.</q>

                     <label>Lord <hi>Conway.</hi>
                     </label>

                     <q>I ſhall move his Majeſty in the beſt Faſhion I can, for your content therein.</q>

                     <label>Anſwer.</label>

                     <q>I thank your Lordſhip, and I doubt not of it: and the rather becauſe I vow before God I am not guilty of the leaſt Offence againſt his Majeſty, and am ready to make it good upon my Life. And I make the like Proteſtation for any unworthineſs done againſt the Duke: whoſe Hand peradventure may be in this Buſineſs.</q>

                     <label>Lord <hi>Conway.</hi>
                     </label>

                     <q>I am ever ready to do good Offices: and if my Lord of <hi>Middleſex</hi> had been perſwaded by me, I believe I had ſaved him: I am the Duke's Servant, but no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his to deſtroy Men. My Lord, I being latly demanded by a great Perſonage, if it were true, that your Lord was guilty of ſuch unworthy Practices towards the Duke, I anſwer'd plainly, I knew of no ſuch things.</q>

For which my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> having receiv'd due Thanks from me, he repeated my Anſwers, and my Petition to the King in few words, that he might not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. At the parting, my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> ſpake about the time of Reſignation. I ſaid it was all one to me, if it were before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> as good ſoon as late. Then I ask'd his Lordſhip if I was reſtrained from the Board before the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Seal: His Lordſhip anſwer'd, <hi>He knew of no ſuch Intent.</hi>

25. <hi>October</hi> 16. Waiting on his Majeſty by my Duty and Place to go to Church, my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> told me, <hi>He was now for me:</hi> I thank'd him, and paſt on to the Church, heard the Sermon, and at the Anthem after Sermon, deſir'd him to tell me my Anſwer. <hi>He ſaid, Well, do you long for it?</hi> And ſo we went on to the upper-end of the Quire, and ſaid to this effect. <hi>This Morning entring into our diſpatches with his Majeſty, I deſir'd him to ſtay a while, that I might relate your Anſwer to him: I told his Majeſty, that you yielded to his Command with all poſſible Obedience: that you ſaid the King remanded but his own, which you were very willing, and ready to reſtore. That for the Condition of three Years you would not diſpute againſt it: being a way, that once you had your ſelf recommended to the late King his Father. But for the Clauſe of retiring to your Biſhoprick (which ſeemed to be a reſtraint, and no cauſe of Offence expreſt) it wounded you much: and you ſent it back to his Majeſty's Conſideration. Then I acquainted his Majeſty with your Lordſhip's deſire, to wait upon him, and to preſent his Majeſty, without touching upon things ſettled and reſolv'd, two Petitions; the one concerning your Reputation, the other concerning your Eſtate. His Majeſty ſaid, for the firſt, which is your retiring, he meant no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Place: but for ſome Queſtions that might be renewed, and for ſome Conſiderations known to himſelf, he intended not to uſe your Service at the Council-Table for a while, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til his Pleaſure ſhould be further known. And for your Eſtate, you had no Wife, and Children. You had a Biſhoprick; and his Father, to help you to bear the Dignity of your Office, gave you leave to hold the Deanry. His Majeſty intended not to debar you of any of theſe, until he ſhould provide you of a better. But he was content to admit you to ſpeak with him when you pleas'd, ſo as you endeavour'd not to unſettle the former Reſolutions.</hi> I gave his Lordſhip hearty thanks for his friendly, and faithful Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of my Petitions, and ſpeedy return of an Anſwer, and aſſur'd his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it was as much Favour from him, as I could expect, or deſire. Then I took occaſion to kneel afterward, and thank'd his Majeſty for his gracious Meſſage ſent by my Lord, who preſently told my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> of it, and my Lord told me of it again. And that the King left it to me, when between this and <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowtide</hi> to deliver the Seal: which he deſir'd for the manner to be done moſt to my Content, and Reputation: and to have ſome time to ſend for him that was to ſucceed. <hi>I anſwer'd I was ready whenever his Majeſty would ſend his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi> Which my Lord deſir'd I would draw up; and ſo we parted.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. I ſent upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> to deſire leave to ſpeak with the King, and Mr. <hi>Tho. Cary</hi> ſent me word, his Majeſty would ſpeak with me the next Morning. But after Sermon the King told my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> what I had done, and was in a long, and ſerious Diſcourſe with him. Then my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> (the King being gone to dinner) followed me into the Cloyſter, and told me what the King had told him: And that he conceiv'd his Majeſty was afraid, that I would preſs him to yield Reaſons of thoſe two Acts of his, the removing me from the Seal, and my abſtaining from the Board. That his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip found the King much troubled thereat: and as a Friend, nay as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, he adviſed me by way of Counſel, not to do ſo: becauſe it would much perplex the King, and do me no good. I anſwer'd, <hi>That I ſhould falſifie my Word to his Lordſhip, if I ſhould ſpeak unto his Majeſty upon any other Points, than thoſe of my Reputation, and Means. And ſhould not come near thoſe forbidden Rocks, unleſs it were in one Point, which I did intend to move, but with his Lordſhip's Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: and that was to preſerve as much the Honoar of the King, as mine own, that for the manner of wiſhing my forbearance for a time from the Council-Board, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty laying nothing to my Charge, would not be pleas'd to lay it as a Command by his Secretary, but leave it to my Diſcretion, who would be ſure to uſe the matter, as to give his Majeſty no Offence. That the reſt of the Points were matters of means, which I repeated to my Lord</hi> Conway <hi>one by one.</hi> And his Lordſhip ſaid, <hi>He thought verily the King would grant them every one.</hi> And his Lordſhip telling me again of his fear of the King's Offence, if I ſhould endeavour to unſettle his Reſolution, and that the King might fall ſharp upon me, I anſwer'd, <hi>That his Lordſhip knew I had neglected the time to wrangle with the King, which ſhould have been done upon the firſt meſſage: Againſt which I had two unanſwerable Objections. The firſt, that the King that dead is, releaſed me of the Reſtraint to three Years in my Office, and continued me in the Place four Years. The ſecond, that the King my Maſter delivered me the Seal as abſolutely, as his Predeceſſors did to other Keepers, and Chancellors, without reviving or mentioning any ſuch Condition. But that I had waved of all Objections, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at the firſt word to relinquiſh my Place.</hi> And for ſharpneſs, or the like word,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49492:131"/>which paſſed from his Lordſhip on <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt, or that the King wiſht my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the Board, leſt Matters might be further queſtion'd (his Lordſhip ſaid he remembred it not) I ſaid, <hi>Nec timeo, nec opto,</hi> it was a thing I did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear like a guilty Man, nor raſhly deſire like a vain-glorious Man. But my wiſhes were to retire to the Country, as without a Charge, by the King's own Confeſſion, ſo, as near as may be, without any puniſhment: which concern'd the King in Honour, I thought, as much as it did me. For God never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys his Creature, but for ſome Sin. And if his Majeſty did think the loſing of my Place did diſquiet me, to give him ſatisfaction, I vowed, and proteſted it did not: which my Lord-Duke alſo had under my hand. And that with his Majeſty's leave and favour, and ſome conſideration had of my Fortunes, I was willing to leave the Seal. Only I expected I ſhould remain a Councellor, tho' leſt to my diſcretion, when to attend, and be reſpected by the Lords from time time, as a Member of the Board. My Lord ſaid, <hi>He conceiv'd it no otherwiſe, and that I might promiſe my ſelf all reſpect from that Table, and his Majeſty in that kind.</hi> Then ſaid I, my Lord, <hi>There remains no more, but that I ſhew a Letter to your Lordſhip written to his Majeſty, if you like it, which ſhall ſpeak all my mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will be utterly ſilent, when I come at Evening before his Majeſty, ſave in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring my Petitions, in which your Lordſhip did encourage me:</hi> Which Letter in the Copy his Lordſhip read over, and carried the Authentick with him. And ſo we parted.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. After Dinner his Majeſty took the Letter, and read that which followeth:</p>

His Requeſts were juſt, modeſt, and ſuitable to his Condition: and the King's Anſwers Princely and Prudent. The Petitioner ask'd firſt for his Majeſty's Grace and Favour in general. His Majeſty granted it, and gave him twice his Hand to kiſs. 2. The Petitioner humbly thanking his Majeſty for his gracious Promiſe, to take away none of his Church-Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till he had given better in lieu thereof, beſought his Majeſty to keep the ſame benevolent Mind towards him: The King ſaid, <hi>It was his Intention.</hi> 3. The Petitioner beſought his Majeſty to remember his Father's Promiſe, made before all the Lords, that whenſoever he took away the Seal, he would place me in as good a Biſhoprick, or Arch-Biſhoprick, as he could: a Promiſe not only ſeconded, but drawn from your Father firſt by your Majeſty. The King ſaid, <hi>There was no ſuch Place yet void: when any fell then it would be time to make this Request unto him,</hi> 4. The Petitioner beſought, that his Majeſty would diſmiſs him freely and abſolutely without any Command from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but to leave it to his diſcretion to forbear: The King ſaid, <hi>He ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſo, and never ſaid a word to the contrary, but expected he would not offend by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Intruſion.</hi> 5. The Petitioner beſought that his Majeſty would declare unto the Lords, that he had willingly, and readily yielded to his Majeſty's Pleaſure, and that I part in your Favour and good Opinion, and am ſtill your Servant. The King ſaid, <hi>He would,</hi> but ſays he, <hi>I look that no Petitions be made for you by any Man at that time, but only for my Favour in general.</hi> 6. The Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner beſought that his Majeſty, in his good time would make his Atonement with my Lord-Duke, either upon, or without Examination of thoſe Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Lord-Duke had receiv'd againſt him. The King ſaid, <hi>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not him, a King, to take up the Quarrels between his Subjects:</hi> And that the Duke had never expreſt any ſuch Enmity againſt him before his Majeſty. The Petitioner thank'd his Majeſty for the laſt part of the Anſwer, which revived him not a little, as did a ſhort Letter lately received from the Counteſs, his Grace's Mother, which he beſought the King to read, and 'twas this.</p>

The King ſaid, <hi>Aſſignments were naught, but he would take order with his Treaſurer, either to pay it, or buy it, as ſhould be found moſt convenient.</hi> 8.

The Petitioner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought, that he might have leave to retire to a little Lodge lent to him by the Lord <hi>Sandys,</hi> where my Lord <hi>Conway</hi> may receive the Seal, when his Majeſty commanded it, in his Journey towards <hi>Windſor.</hi> The King granted it. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Petitioner beſought, that the King would not be offended at him, if upon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49492:132"/>his diſcharge, reports were made that he was diſcontented, which he proteſted he was not, giving over ſo comfortably in his Majeſty's Favour.

And certainly his Majeſty meant real Performance of all his Anſwers, both becauſe, he limited them ſo warily, in all his Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and becauſe, if he were left to himſelf, he lov'd to keep his Word. For he was obſerv'd in all his Reign, that he ſeldom trod awry, but by miſtruſting his own Judgment, and falling from it for their Perſwaſions, that came ſhort of him a great deal in Wit, and Honeſty.

If he be too paſſive, he will be counted, at the beſt, but in the middle Rank of Men: who ſhould not be contented with mediocrity of Reputation.

They ſhall anſwer for it to God. I will only put this little Syrup into the Reader's Mouth, to take away the ill reliſh of thoſe Defamations, that the Fire of Envy would have gone out by this time, but that there is a Pile of Vertue left behind, to keep it burning Yet even thoſe Men have ſcarce given him a little ſcratch, or no more, anent his Epiſcopal Adminiſtration of his Dioceſs: <hi>He made that Office a good Work,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.1.

For four Years after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, he was not in Condition, through the great Burthen of other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, to appear among his Clergy. But it is well known to them that lived under his Charge in thoſe days, that both Miniſtry, and Laity were greatly ſatisfied with his Government. For his Encouragements to the Beſt-deſerving were very kind, his Diſpatches were never intermitted, and his Directions ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look'd after, to be obſerv'd by thoſe that were under him, in any part of his Juriſdiction. Yet to reach no further than Truth, from this time forward his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence wrought more, than his Subſtitutes in his abſence: his Light ſhin'd clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Influence of it was ſtronger, when he was ſix'd, and reſident in his own Orb. As <hi>Columella</hi> commends it wittily to an Owner, to live upon his own Ground, if he would thrive; ſays he, <hi>Fimus optimus in agro est Domini veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium:</hi> So the Vineyard of Chriſt in every part of it will proſper beſt, when the Vine-dreſſer himſelf doth walk about the Field.

And the Biſhop having now no more to do with civil Diſtractions, bethought him inſtantly of the Duty of his Paſtoral Staff, made Proviſion for an Houſhold, which attended him in a great Retinue, and removed from <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> without touching at <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Bugden</hi> in <hi>Hunting donſhire.</hi> His Privacy at <hi>Foxly</hi> conceal'd his Double-diligence, to make haſte to be gone, leſt more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould ſhower upon him if he tarried.

He might now do, as well as know the meaning, what the Scriptures intend, when they ſay that Rulers go in, and out before the People. For how can they go out unto them, that are never in among them?

And Winter cannot be more miry in any Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> than it is round about it. He found an Houſe nothing to his content to entertain him. 'Twas large enough, but rude, waſte, untrimm'd, and, in much of the outward Dreſs, like the grange of a Farmer. From the time of his Predeceſſor, Dr. <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> that was Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and ſat there in the Days of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and laid out much upon that place, none that followed him, no not <hi>Splendian Woolſey,</hi> did give it any new Addition: but rather ſuffered it to be overgrown with the Decays of an ill-favour'd Antiquity. This Biſhop did Wonders in a ſhort time, with the Will of a liberal Man, and the Wit of a good Surveyor: For, in the ſpace of one Year, with many Hands, and good Pay, he turn'd a ruinous thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtately Manſion. The out Houſes, by which all ſtrangers paſt, were the greateſt Eye-ſore; theſe he pluck'd down to the Ground, and re-edified with convenient Beauty, as well for uſe, as uniformity. Theſe were Stables, Barns, Granaries, Houſes for Doves, Brewing, and Dairies: And the outward Courts, which were next them, he caſt into fair Allies, and Graſs-plats. Within Doors the Cloyſters were the trimmeſt part of his Reparations: the Windows of the Square beautified with Stories of colour'd Glaſs; the Pavement laid ſmooth and new: and the Walls on every ſide hung with Pieces of exquiſite Workmen in Limning, collected and provided long before. The like, and better was done for the Chappel in all theſe Circumſtances; and with as much coſt as it was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of: For the over-ſight from the beginning was, that it was the only Room in the Houſe that was too little. He planted Woods, the Trees in many places deviſed by him into Ranks and Proportions: But Woods are the moſt needful Supplies for Poſterity, and the moſt neglected. He fenced the Park, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with Deer. He provided for good Husbandry, and bought in the Leaſes of the Demeaſnes, for them that would ſtock the Grounds; which improvident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for hunger of Monies, were let out to the very Gates.

He loved ſtirring and walking, which he uſed two hours or more, every day in the open Air, if the Weather ſerv'd: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he might go to and fro, where good Scents, and Works of well-form'd Shape were about him. But that this was his innocent Recreation, it would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to an Error, that he ſhould bury ſo much Money in Gardens, Arbors, Orchards, Pools for Water-fowls, and for Fiſh of all variety, with a Walk raiſed three Foot from the Ground, of about a Mile in compaſs, ſhaded and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered on each ſide with Trees, and Pales. He that reports this knows beſt, that all the Nurſeries about <hi>London</hi> for fair Flowers, and choice Fruits were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack'd to furniſh him. <hi>Alcinous,</hi> if he had lived at <hi>Bugden,</hi> could not have liv'd better. And all this, take it together, might have ſtood to become five Ages after his Reparation. But what is there that appears now; or what remains of all this Coſt and Beauty?

So he had more Gueſts at his Table of generous and noble Extraction, than any Prelate in a long Memory before; for the Muſick of his great Chamber, which did feed, and relieve the Ear, was ſought unto, more than the Cheer which was prepared for the Belly.

The Houſe, as great as it was, was likely well ſill'd. The Maſter of it delighted not in Solitude: for he loved not to ſave Charges. Beſide ſuch Paſſengers, he ſeldom ſat to Meat without ſome of the Clergy, commonly a Coovy. The very Yeamanry of Faſhion of the adjacent Towns were welcome, not only to his Hall, but to his Board. And though the Reſort was ſuch, yet he liv'd in that Order and Method, that his more ſerious thoughts were ſeldom interrupted with Domeſtick Affairs. The Poor were ſharers in this Hoſpitality, more than any for their number, with whom he deſired to divide the Goods of the Earth, that he might divide with them the Joys of Heaven. <hi>Aequè pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aequè,</hi> Horat.

It is the chief end of repaſt with Friends. <hi>Propter Sermonis de lectationem tempeſtivis convivits delector.</hi> Cicer. de Senect.

He could make himſelf all things to all Men, and cloſe with all ſorts, according to their Argument, and Capacity. If a Barly-corn were fitter for ſome than a Pearl, he would ſcrape it out for them. Where it was vain to ſound the ſhallowneſs of ſome with a deep Line, he inſtructed them with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, after their own meaſure. But when he had the Society of them, that were of good Reading, and ſtrong Notions, he would propoſe, and hear, and reply, and canvaſs a Queſtion with that Reaſon, and Inſtances of Antiquity, yet with ſuch a Guſt of Hilarity, that he contented all with his Judgment, and endeared them to him with his Civility. Far more might be ſaid than this to his praiſe: but it is better to ſupply it with Admiration. And becauſe his Breaſts were full, and had need to be drawn: the choiceſt, and moſt able of both Univerſities came thick unto him; as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Sixtinus, p.</hi> 140. writes of ſome learned Men, that invited themſelves to a Meal with him, <hi>Ejuſmodi homines, qui Academiam poſſint facere, non modò convivium:</hi> So ſuch company was often about the Biſhop, as made <hi>Bugden</hi> look like an Academy, and the Cheer like a Commencement. None could reach himſelf out with more Humanity to pleaſe them all, unleſs any thought it troubleſome, as I think they did not, that he continued Diſcourſe till Midnight, or after. From <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that being ſo near, and he ſo hoſpital, he was daily viſited. But when Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Brownrigg</hi> (now the Right Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Exon</hi>) came to do him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with their obſervance, it was an high Feaſt with him. Theſe were Saints of the red Letter in the Calendar of his Acquaintance. <hi>Occurrunt animae, quales neque candidiores—Terra tulit,</hi> Horat. This noble Pair were both moſt Godly, moſt Learned, moſt Humble; fit to make Friends with the moſt vertuous, and chiefly, (for ſo it was) between themſelves.

Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> in the Chair a rare Determiner: Dr. <hi>Brownrigg</hi> in the Schools an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Diſputant, and in the Pulpit a moſt divine Preacher: As <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid of <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Scevola, In aliquibus diſſimiles erant inter ſe, ſtatuere tamen ut non poſſis,</hi>

He that received ſuch as theſe under his Roof, might be comforted, not that he received Angels unawares, but Chriſt himſelf in his Diſciples. This Matter might have broken off here, but that Mr. <hi>W. S.</hi> who likes the Gallantry of the Biſhop's Houſe-keeping, adds that which was very true, that Watches were ſet to note, and eſpy him. Warning was given by ſome, that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to it. The Court is not always the cloſeſt Cabinet to keep Secrets: As <hi>Budaeus</hi> obſerves it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Aſſe. fol.</hi> 105. <hi>Aius ille Locutius arcanum nihil ſinit eſſe eorum, quae in Aulâ geruntur.</hi> But the Biſhop would take no knowledge, that ſuch a Snare was laid; eſteeming of it as Phyſicians do of <hi>Cancer Occultus,</hi> that it is more ſafe to let it alone, than to go about to cure it: nor was it eaſie for him to keep in his Freedom: Which yet many times had ſubtlety mixt with it; ſuch as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſays was in <hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> That he would ſeem open in his Talk, out of an admirable Dexterity to make others ſpeak freely. But more often cuſtom did make his Words run from him, without regard to thoſe that might be ſuſpected: As <hi>Camerarius</hi> writes of <hi>Melanchthon, Oratio ejus erat libera, etiam ſine circumſpectione, &amp; conſideratione eorum, coram quibus illa haberetur.</hi> Where much Knowledge, and a ſweet Nature meet with intelligent Company, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will flow without an over-anxious advertency upon the Hearers. Yet Offence could never be grounded upon his Words, if a candid Interpretation judg'd them. Doubtleſs he that had loſt one Eye, would be more tender to keep the other. As for thoſe Spies, and State-rats that are ſet to run, and ſcent in every corner; <hi>Budaeus,</hi> a great Courtier as well as a Scholar, in his Work cited before, <hi>Fol.</hi> 188. Accounts them to be moſt ignoble Inſtruments, bred at firſt under the ragged Princes of <hi>Aſia.</hi> But he that did moſt employ them was <hi>Midas,</hi> King of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which gave occaſion to the Fable, that he had Aſſes Ears. <hi>Quem narrant aſininas aures habuiſſe, quod multos otacouſtas, auricularios, &amp; ſermonum captatores haberet.</hi> Thiſtles were fitter for ſuch Aſſes to feed on, than the ſumptuous proviſion of a moſt bountiful Lord.</p>

And that was all the good they did. But as this Biſhop's Table was free and open, ſo was his Hand: Except Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who was ſublime in all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, there was not ſo great a Giver of his Order, to the Supply of the Learned, and of Gentlemen of hard Fortune: whom he gratified with no ſmall Sums.

The ſame Author hath inſtanced in one of the beſt, to whom he did miniſter out of his ſtore, the Man whoſe Renown will ever be freſh, Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> the Elder; Who flying from the mortal Threatnings of his Enemies at the time of the Siege of <hi>Mount-Alban,</hi> and finding harbour in <hi>England,</hi> was not only furniſh'd for his preſent uſe by this compaſſionate Providor, but he ſent alſo for his Son Dr. <hi>Peter</hi> the younger out of <hi>France,</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd him a Deacon, to make him capable of his Patronage, inſtituted him into a Donative, one of the beſt in North <hi>Wales,</hi> and cauſed him to engage, that Proviſion ſhould be made out of it for his Mother-in-Law, as it were in the way of a Joynture, if the ſurvived his Father. A Benefit which the Father, that great Pillar of the Reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> neither ſought, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. For he had never ſeen his face that conferr'd it: and came ſo welcome to diſcharge him from all further care of laying up for his Family, that among his other rate Gifts, he proved the moſt acknowledging, true-hearted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Friend, that ever the Biſhop had to do with. From whom he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented every Month with all thoſe Rarities, which the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and State ſet forth.

For though the Government, and comely Order of our Church is far better contrived than theirs, through the good Hand of God upon us, yet he was not pufft up, like ſome, that think their Imperfections make them unworthy of Communion with us. Is there but one Tree of Knowledge in all the <hi>Paradice</hi> of the Church of God? Or muſt all be deſpiſed that are not reformed <hi>ad amuſſim? The good God pardon every one, that prepareth his heart to ſeek the Lord God of his Fathers, though he be not cleanſed according to the purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sanctuary,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.19.

It was never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by thoſe about him, that he gather'd much in his great Office. He was provident indeed, and let nothing run waſte: and honeſt Thriſt will help to ſave a few Spoonfuls, but not ſo much as to fill a Ciſtern. I can refer it no better, I am certain, than to the unknown Bleſſing of God, who multiplied his Subſtance the more, becauſe he gave it chearfully. For in the midſt of his Profuſeneſs he fell upon Works of great Munificence, which could not come into a narrow Mind, nor be finiſh'd by a narrow Fortune. <gap reason="foreign">

This Palace, fit for the Pomp of thoſe great Potentates, was formidable to their poor Succeſſors, that could not keep it warm, with the Rents that remain'd. But it was come into the Poſſeſſion of one, that did not ſtick at ſuch Conſiderations. For although it did ſeem irreparable in the Dilapidations; and Workmen did ask ſo much, as the Neighbours of the Cloſe did think it would deter the Maſter of it, yet in three Years he brought it on, and up, to as much ſtrength and comlineſs, as when it was firſt inhabited.

Many a Sabbath-days Journey he took to the adjacent Towns, to let them ſee, and hear their Dioceſan: not omitting the Punctilio of the Canon, to ſtir them up to the Reading, and Hearing of Holy Scriptures, but taught it with much variety from <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead.

Gold doth not give a ſhrill noiſe, like ſounding Braſs, or tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49492:138"/>but it is rich, and precious. The Multitude, by ill cuſtom, look for Clamour, ſtrong Lungs, and weak Doctrine. But happy are thoſe Auditors, that can try which is a golden Bell, upon the Touch-ſtone of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and run not giddy after them, whoſe words are hot in the Mouth, and cold in digeſtion. Thoſe Ages did afford the beſt Diſciples, that learnt their Principles from the graveſt Fathers. And the People did profit moſt, where the Biſhops preacht moſt. As St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, that ſo long as he ſtaid at <hi>Millain,</hi> every <hi>Sunday</hi> he heard the great Doctor, St. <hi>Ambroſe. Millain,</hi> or any other City; <hi>Bethany,</hi> or any Hamlet, would forſake others to hear them. It was ſo with us in <hi>England,</hi> to the brink of our great Change. High and low, of all ſorts and degrees came with their greateſt Attention to hear the Sermon of a Biſhop. Their very Habit, which ſet them forth with Comelineſs, did affect ſome: the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their high Calling did move others: the Contemplation of their Learning and Wiſdom, which had advanc'd them, did work more: their painfulneſs in their Duty did pleaſe all. Upon which of theſe hinges the Delight of the People did turn, I diſpute not. It is enough that it was apparent, that the Meſſage of God was heard with moſt reverence, when it was deliver'd by one that look'd like an extraordinary Embaſſador. Above all, thoſe chief Paſtors were the beſt Trumpets to ſound a Retreat from Innovations. <gap reason="foreign">

Much of the Wool was ready, yet not ſpun out, for the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intended, becauſe his Loom was broken. To ſpeak it out diſtinctly; Mr. <hi>Richard Gouland,</hi> Keeper of the Library of the College of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> (till Men of good Parts in all kinds, himſelf not the leaſt, were deprived) he hath in his Cuſtody the Bible in three Parts in a large Folio, with the Tranſlation of <hi>Jun.</hi> and <hi>Tremell.</hi> bound together, wherein are Notes upon all the Scriptures (except the <hi>Apocaclyps</hi> which is untouch'd) written with the Biſhop's own Hand: in which are drawn out of all kind of Authors, of the firſt, middle, and chiefly the latter Age, and out of all Languages, as the prime of <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> with the modern of <hi>Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> whatſoever is the Choice and Flower of their Commentations.

But the increaſe of this Knowledge increas'd his Sorrow, with the great Declenſion of his Health; As the Poet ſays,

Yet he knew, that to expound the whole Scripture learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was above the Powers, and Parts of one Man. Therefore he reſerv'd both the filling, and finiſhing of it, to the aſſiſtance of Twelve, or more, of the ableſt Scholars in the Land, whom he had in his Eye, and Thoughts, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Recompence of a great Stipend. For he hath ſaid it to his Friends, that he would not ſtick at the Sum of Twelve, no, nor of Twenty thouſand Pounds to perfect that Maſter-piece of Divinity. But this young Feature, like an imperfect Embryo, was mortified in the Womb by Star-Chamber Vexations. A Letter from King <hi>Ataxerxes</hi> cauſed <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the Builders with him, to ceaſe from working. Yet ſo much of the Stuff, as was made ready with his own Pen in Three Volumes, if it be not depoſited in the Library at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Author will be wrong'd in his Fame, and Poſterity in the Profit. His invincible Mind was not ſatisfied with this Task alone. But as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpake to <hi>Trajan; Paneg.</hi> p. 57. <hi>Inter refectiones exiſtimas mutationem laboris.</hi> So to paſs from one Study to another, was not a new Labour, but the Biſhop's Recreation.

Theſe being in Manuſcript, and many obſcur'd in blind Corners, this Biſhop collected, digeſted them, had wrote Arguments upon divers parts of them, which others have read, as well as my ſelf: expected daily more and more of the ſame Author, that all that could be got, might be printed fairly together.

Wherein (I rejoyce in the truth) he that is before us was as ſtrict an examiner of Novices, as any of his Order. Some that were not admitted by him in his firſt Ordinations, becauſe they were found Light upon the Weight, ſaved him much work afterward. Divinity is a deep, and a copious Science; wherein he that fear'd he could not anſwer his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would not venture upon his repulſe. For he was ſo conſtant, and regular, that they knew what to truſt to, before they came to him. Whether the <hi>34th.</hi> Canon, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1604. ambiguouſly penn'd, will allow one to be made a Deacon, or Prieſt, that can yield an account of his Faith in <hi>Latin,</hi> according to the Articles of the Convocation 1562, though bred in no Univerſity, is diſputable.

And certain it is beſt to admit none, but ſuch as have walk'd before the Learnedſt of the Kingdom in their Education. It is a Reſolution which will fall on its feet, and ſtand ſure. It pieces well with that of the Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt rejected Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I will alſo reject thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt unto me.</hi> It diſcountenanceth Mechanicks, and the loweſt of the People, that they intrude not to teach more than they had ever learnt. Barricadoes of empty Barrels, whoſe ſound is the louder, becauſe they have no Liquor. Let me beſtow a good Story upon them, who never read Arts, or Stories. <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> a meer Quack, told <hi>Galen,</hi> that he would teach Men in a Month or two to become good Phyſicians, that had not the Elements of Philoſophy. Oil-men, Butchers, ſome of the Gentle-craſt left their Trades to learn this compendious way of <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> to adminiſter Phyſick, <hi>Sed in perniciem generis humani, ſays Galen.</hi> The Empyricks got Money, but their Patients got their death. 'Tis far worſe when ſuch <hi>Theſſalians</hi> Practiſe upon the Soul, that never came out of the Schools of the Prophets: and amuſe poor People with Confidence, and Boldneſs. And great Boldneſs was never without great Abſurdity. Now every one that is a Candidate of Holy Orders, brings a Teſtimony with him to the Biſhop, for the Commendation of his honeſt Life: often Subſcrib'd formally, and with little Advice, and when Men are prevail'd upon in their Weakneſs, I mean when they are over entreated. Yet he that receives it can hear with no other Ears. Then why ſhould he be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt, if other Names have broken with him? If ſome are ſo eaſie to paſs their Names under ſuch Letters of Commendation, as if a Libertine in Life were like to be transform'd, nay tranfigur'd, by that ſacred Calling, he is greatly out: allbeit thoſe words were pronounced, when Hands were impoſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye the Holy Ghoſt. Which is not ſpoken of the Grace, which makes Men gracious with God, but of the Office of Grace. <hi>Iſocrates</hi> in <hi>Areopag.</hi> Oration ſays, <hi>That a looſe Man, choſen to be a Judge in the Court of</hi> Mars-hill, <hi>incontinently became ſtrict and temperate.</hi> Which was a Flattery that <hi>Budaeus</hi> flouts at, <hi>Pr. pars Pandec.</hi> p. 283. <hi>Tanquam loci genio afflatus ex ingenio ſuo migraſſet.</hi> I would not believe but a Wolf would be a Wolf ſtill, if he were choſen a Shepherd, though all the Beaſts in the Wilderneſs ſhould Vote the contrary in his behalf. This is the blind ſide on which the Biſhop could not ſee ſo perfectly himſelf, whether he that came to be adopted into the Miniſtry, were unblamable in his Life.

He that had the common Laws and Statutes at his Fingers end: he that was a great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſt: a learned Civilian: a Maſter of Reaſon: a dextrous Wit at diſpatch: that knew the fair and foul Dealings of the Spiritual Courts, was as ſit a Man, as ever our Church had, to be Preſident of a Conſiſtory. In that Circle he was like <hi>Onias</hi> the High Prieſt, <hi>as a morning Star in the midſt of a Cloud,</hi> Ecclus. 50.6. For Clouds there were, and dark ones; as no place of Judicature is without them. The Biſhop loved the Profeſſion of the Civil Laws, as <hi>Valentine</hi> to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: and pitied the Advocates, that were ſhut up to meddle with ſo few Cauſes, that they could neither ſhew their Learning, nor thrive by their Studies. Yet he did often tell them (all are not dead that heard him) that unleſs they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their Courts with Incorruption and Integrity: with Impartiality in Cauſes, and making choice of ſuch Quarrels to come before them, as vertuous Men thought fitteſt to be redreſt, a little would come to nothing. Himſelf would not let Church-wardens be cited, for the placing of the Holy Table: nor the People for not coming to the Rail, at the receiving of the Elements of the Lord's Supper. It is a good Proviſo which an Heathen gave <hi>Symm. Ep.</hi> p. 14. <hi>Si adjiciantur inſolita, forſan conſueta ceſſabunt.</hi> By thruſting in new Ordinances, old Obedience might be ſhaken.

And ſuch Injunctions are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, and deducted ſo far off out of our known and eſtabliſh'd Rules, that they were to be offer'd, and perſwaded, rather than commanded. Conſtraint, and Violence are not means to bring ſuch things to uniformity. More often by Sufferance, Obedience will break in between their Wiſhes. Likewiſe it was <hi>Vox populi,</hi> and therefore not to be contemn'd, that Officers Eccleſiaſtical did proſecute Preſentments, rather againſt Non-conformitancy of Miniſters and People, than for Debaucheries of an evil Life, mention'd in the 109 Canon. Wherein the Biſhop did not commend the Proceedings of his deputed Judges. Though it might be ſaid in favour of them, that Humane Laws are ſtricteſt againſt them that act contrary to publick Peace. Or that Crimes are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Statutes, and are fitter for Tryal at a Quarter Seſſions. Some ſpied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Reaſon, that Proctors and Regiſters wanted not thoſe Scandals themſelves, for which, in the Eye of the World, they were fit to be preſented. Yet when all is ſaid, it were more laudable in Courts Chriſtian, to be more ſevere againſt Evils which the Light of Nature had made Evils, than againſt Evils, which were made Evils by the Laws of Holy Church. Both were to be corrected: but rather Works of Commiſſion againſt known Light, than Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes of Omiſſion for want of Light of Underſtanding. The hardeſt Task which the Biſhop had, was to perſwade his Officers to live by honeſt Gains: to moderate their Fees: to waſh their Hands from bribes, and filthy Lucre: the only way to live in clear Fame, that Men might ſpeak well of them, and of their Authority. <hi>Covetouſneſs is not a Branch, but a Root of Evil,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul:</hi> all that grows may be ſeen in a Plant, but not the Root.

If a Curſe were of moment, as when a whole Pariſh were in a Broil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, the biſhop appointed a Conſiſtory to rule it with his own Preſence, and Judgment.

Wherein he ſpared himſelf ſo little, and gave ſo much eaſe to the People, that he did often ride to the parts of his Dioceſs remoteſt from his ordinary home, as <hi>Leiceſter, Buckinghamſhire, Wellen</hi> in <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> &amp;c. and kept his Courts, where all the Complainants were at hand to attend them. A way of great content, and much neglected. Yet the 125 Canon provides, That all Officials ſhould appoint meet places for the keeping of their Courts, as ſhould be expedient for entertainment of thoſe that made their appearance, and moſt indifferent for their Travail,—and that they may return homewards in as due ſeaſon as may be. But theſe Courts, which kept Peace among the Sons of the Church, and ſuper-intended over Delinquents are quite ex-autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized: taken in pieces as muſty Veſſels, wherein nothing kept ſweet, that was put into them. The Fault was in the Demoliſhers, that had no better Scent: they had Noſes and ſmelt not. For whereas the Grievance pretended was, that they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49492:141"/>had too much Power; the Truth is on the contrary, that they could not do their work as they ought, to ſatisfie the People, and to beat down Sin, becauſe they had too little. Take their higheſt, and in a manner their only cenſure, Excommunication (terrible in it ſelf) What doth a profane Perſon care for it?

Upon that Head I will give account what Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> did in particular Caſes, two, and no more: Then his Diſcharge in the general Meetings ſhall bound, and ſhut it up. The former was the Diſcovery of a Miſchief; and the killing of it in the Birth, in <hi>April,</hi> 1629. with which <hi>Jane Hawkins</hi> teemed, a Propheteſs (for ſhe would go for no leſs) in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Ives</hi> in <hi>Hunting donſhire:</hi> Who took her Bed for a Sickneſs, and was in perfect Health: and in that ſickneſs had her Extaſies, as it was bruited: and in thoſe Extaſies utter'd Verſes in Rythm, full of Detraction and Injury to the Authority of the Biſhops, to the Church-way of <hi>England</hi> in the Liturgy, and not ſparing ſome Occurrences of the Civil Government. This was a Cheat, like that of Mr. <hi>R. Hadocks</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign Who was a learned Impoſtor, preaching <hi>Latin</hi> Sermons of a very elegant Stile in his ſleep, as the cunning Man would have it believ'd, as if thoſe Enthuſiaſms were vented by his Tongue, but he had no Senſe of them in his Mind. And this tended to make his Auditors conceive, that God cauſed him, like <hi>Balaam</hi>'s dumb Beaſt, to teach another Diſcipline, than that which was eſtabliſh'd. But this Woman, though taught her Leſſon by ſome more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than her ſelf, utter'd ſuch Brainleſs Verſes, as might juſtifie the common Ballads of the City; and was as bad at an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe, as the old Monks were at a <hi>Latin,</hi> ſtufft with ſuch frigid Jeſts, as were able to cool the Bath. <hi>Ut pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priùs ſpectes lacrymoſa poemata Puppi,</hi> Horat.

The Extaſie, or Inſpiration, believ'd by ſome, was the offence like to do harm. Which the Biſhop perceiving to be a deviſed Villany, diſguiſed himſelf in his Face, and Habit, and obtain'd to thruſt in, with two more, among the Crew, at ſuch a time, as they came to watch for Oracles from the Mouth of this Poetreſs. Blind Guides are fitteſt for them that would wander. When the Fit was upon her, one of her Intimates took her Vapourings, as they came from her, <hi>Et jungere carmina curat,</hi> Virgil. Aen. leſt they ſhould be loſt like thoſe of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Beldame.</hi> Which the Biſhop taking out of his Hand, found them alter'd for the better, and at that juncture reveal'd himſelf to their Amazement, and made it evident to them, that were preſent, that all their Feats were ſtark Juggling: that they took God's Name in vain, as if thoſe Notions came from God, which came from Fraud, and from Satan: falſe, in much bitter without Charity: bold and rude, not ſavouring of the Stile of God, nor of any wiſe Man, but Mr. <hi>Wiſe</hi> the Curate. And although their Conditions would excuſe all that could be done to them in Severity, yet the Biſhop required no more, but that Mr. <hi>Tooky</hi> the Vicar, upon pain of Suſpenſion ſhould read the Contents of a Paper ſent to him, the next <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 29. after the firſt Leſſon in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Church; then his Suſpenſion to be ſtaid, otherwiſe to be declar'd. Which Contents are theſe: In thoſe Sayings uttered by <hi>Jane Hawkins</hi> of this Pariſh, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of late, or heretofore in her Sickneſs, which ſeemed for the Manner ſtrange and extraordinary, and expreſſed in Verſe or Rhyme, I do not conceive any Miracle at all: or for that manner in Verſe or Rhyme any Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, added over and above the Gifts, and Parts of Nature: Nor would I have any Man or Woman of this Pariſh, to have a higher Opinion, or Conceit of any Saying ſo utter'd by the ſaid <hi>Jane Hawkins.</hi> And whereas my ſelf, Mr. <hi>Wiſe</hi> my Curate, and my Son have taken and excerpted many of theſe Sayings in Verſe from the Mouth of the ſaid <hi>Jane,</hi> in the Preſence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, and Women in this Pariſh, and put the ſame in Writing, which is conceiv'd to be an Act that may prove ſcandalous to the Church, and State, I

This was read, and the Offence was paſt over with this gentleneſs. But the Vicar fell either into this Error again, or ſome other Contumacy. For in fine he was deprived, as I find it in the Biſhop's Papers. Their own tatling, and venting their Malice by a talkative Woman, brought all this ſhame upon them. They might have been as wiſe as the wild Geeſe that fly over the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> who carry a Stone in their Bills, to keep them from gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling, leſt the Eagle ſhould hear them, and ſeize upon them.</p>

It is a ſlight occaſion, yet an occaſion to conſider in a little the Sibylls, and their Predictions from hence, becauſe I have ſtarted a Feminine Verſifier, and a Propheteſs (yea, what elſe?) among her Copes-mates. To come to a ſhort Tryal, I lay nothing forth of the Fatidical Books, which <hi>Tarquin</hi> bought of his reſolute Chap-woman. They were conſum'd to Aſhes in the Social War, and not a Fragment ſaved. Nor of thoſe Pieces which <hi>Tully</hi> quotes, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Divin.</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> Ecl. 4. the two great Maſters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Learning. It is not certain whither they be extant in the Remains that are publiſh'd, and to be ſeen at this day. I meddle with nothing which their Meſſengers collected in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> to furniſh their Capitol with new Oracles. I look on no other than thoſe eight Books of Sibylline Propheſies, with the Fragments annexed, ſet out by <hi>Opſopaeus,</hi> and others, and ſtand firſt in the Third Volume of the Greek <hi>Bibliotheca Patrum.</hi> I look I ſay upon no more: and move no more than one Queſtion upon them. Whether all that is in them, nay whether any part of them, was penned by Propheteſſes living among the Gentiles, and living before the coming of Chriſt Jeſus in the Fleſh? What I reſolve in it I branch into ſeven Concluſions. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſome part of theſe Oracles, which we have in our Uſe and Poſſeſſion, were endited before the Incarnation of our Lord; and in ſome Verſes where Chriſt is foretold, that he ſhould come, and reign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth, together with the Diſſipation of Idolatry, and other Heatheniſh Rites. For albeit in thoſe Paſſages they had not Credit with ſome in <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s time: and in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, the Propheſies of others, that were not <hi>Jews,</hi> concerning Chriſt, were thought to be forg'd by Chriſtians, <hi>Ci. Dei, Lib.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 47. Yet I cannot incline to that Diffidence for this reaſon. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays they were quoted by <hi>Clemens,</hi> known to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> either in an Epiſtle loſt, or loſt out of that Epiſtle which is now come to light: Likewiſe by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> bordering upon the Times of the Apoſtles. And they quoted them, as atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Honour of our Chriſtian Cauſe. Therefore ſomewhat of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical reliſh was in them, ante-nated, and in being before the Goſpels were written. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Antiquity hath voiced it, that Women were the Authors of them; which none hath contradicted: The Wits of that Sex have excell'd in Odes and Madrigals. In holy Hymns alſo. As <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barac</hi> are named, <hi>Jud.</hi> 5. but firſt <hi>Deborah,</hi> for chanting that Triumphal Song, which hath as much Art, and Dithyrambical Loftineſs in it, as is in any <hi>Syrick</hi> Poetry, <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> And if we had more of <hi>Miriam</hi>'s Song, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.21. it would not come behind them. And God did open great Secrets by ſuch Inſtruments, as his Hand-maids; who ever did his wonders by weakeſt means: and provok'd the World to attend to ſuch Conveyance, as was ſtrange, and to which they were not wonted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They were Gentiles: the <hi>Jews</hi> never owned them; and it is already proved, that they lived before the Diſciples were call'd Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at <hi>Antioch.</hi> The very learned Biſhop <hi>Montague</hi> ſhould have look'd to it in his 3 <hi>Cap.</hi> of Acts and Monuments, how he diſputed, that they were all Gentiles; and caſts about that the firſt and chief lived in the Days of <hi>Abraham,</hi>

I would bring them nearer to the times of Grace, upon this thought; that as ſome note of the Jews, that after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> about Five Hundred Years before Chriſt's Nativity, they were in <hi>Limine Eccleſiae,</hi> as it were in the Porch of the Church, and ſaw into the Myſtery of Salvation, more clearly for the generality of the People, than before: yet no Prophet was among them: So the nearer the time drew, that the day ſpring from on high did viſit us, the more did Divinations abound among the Heathens, to prepare them for that Bleſſing: as it may be enlarged from the <hi>Magi</hi> of the Eaſt, that came to viſit our Saviour. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I leave theſe Propheteſſes to God that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49492:143"/>knows the Heart, whether they had the Spirit of Belief, and of the Knowledge of that they utter'd; That is, whether they were impulled like <hi>Balaam, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to vent that which they could not keep in; or whether they were inſpired like <hi>Eſaias,</hi> and the Prophets of the Lord. There is no Hiſtory how ſhe, or more ſhees lived, or what end they made, which were the means, and none elſe, to decide it. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Take the Sibylline Oracles in a lump, ſo as now they are deliver'd to us, and they have a great of deal of Addition, and Fraudulency in them: The Interlinings of a Chriſtian Pen are as manifeſt as the Sun at Noon-day. <hi>Quò apertiora ſunt, cò mihi ſuſpectiora,</hi> I conſent to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon,</hi> Num. 17.

But, with favour, he hath not done his Work, that makes a Conjecture poſſible, but that makes it probable.

Some ſmall Intimation of each, <hi>Antoninus</hi> follows. But then all that comes after, is ſhuffled up, nothing clear, nothing particular, not a glance made at a ſucceeding Emperor, I have heard good Antiquaries diſcourſe, that our Britiſh Prophecies aſcribed to <hi>Merlin,</hi> were the Fruit of ſome Writer in the Days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. <hi>Merlin</hi> the <hi>Fay,</hi> ſuppoſed to be a Wizard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary to King <hi>Arthur,</hi> lived Seven Hundred Years before.

They were full of Faith, and never fear'd, that Chriſt's Kingdom did need a Lye to advance it. I have read of Stratagems military, and political: but Martyrs, and Saints would never give countenance to Stratagems Theological. But who looks moſt ſuſpiciouſly, of all that lived in that Age, to bear the blame of ſuch a Forgery? It is an hard thing to find a Father for a Baſtard. But, <hi>Reader,</hi> What think you of <hi>Montanus,</hi> and his Baggages about him, <hi>Maximilla, Priſca, Quintilla,</hi> call'd <hi>Cata-Phrygians</hi> from the place of their wont?

I am only dubious therefore in this laſt Concluſion. Perhaps I have not the Door by the Ring. He that likes it not, let him bite a Bay-leaf, and make a better Divination.

At all times one, or more, by their Conſtitutions were drawn aſide to ſome private Holy Exerciſe. By night they kept watch in the Houſe of the Lord, and two by turns did ſupply the Office for the reſt, from whence they departed not till the Morning. Their Scope was to be ready like wiſe Virgins with Oil in their Lamps, when the Bridegroom came.

                  <p>The Biſhop pray'd to God that many ſuch Cuſtomers might come to him: ſo commended her free-will Offering to God, and confirm'd it. To make them ſome amends for their Liberality to the Church, he deviſed how to give them Reputation, againſt ad Detraction. Therefore in the Spring that came after, he gave them warning on what <hi>Sunday</hi> he would Preach in their Church: whither an extreme Preſs of People reſorted from all the Towns that heard of it. In his Sermon he inſiſted moſt, what it was to die <hi>unto the World:</hi> that the Righteous ſhould ſcarce be ſaved: that our right Eye, and our right Hand, and all our fleſhly Contentments muſt be cut off, that we may enter into Life. All tended to approve the dutiful, and ſevere Life of the <hi>Farrars,</hi> and of the Church that was in their Houſe. After Sermon the Biſhop took their Invitation to Dine with them. But they were ſo ſtrict to keep that day holy, that they left not a Servant at home to provide for the Table. Yet it was handſomely furniſh'd with that which was boil'd, and bak'd, that requir'd no Attendance, to ſtay any one from Church to look to it. By this viſit the Biſhop had the Means to ſee their way of ſerving God; to know the Soundneſs of Doctrine which they maintain'd, to read their Rules which they had drawn up for Faſts, and Vigils, and large Diſtributions of Alms: In which he bad them proceed in the Name of God, and gave them his Bleſſing at his departing. From thenceforth theſe faithful ones flouriſh'd in good opinion. For it is certain what <hi>Quintilian</hi> hath ſtated in Gratory, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Nulla ſunt firmiora, quàm quae ex dubiis facta ſunt corta.</hi> The more a Caſe was doubted, the clearer it is, when the Doubt is reſolv'd.</p>

For I muſt not hold it in, that ſome Perſons in <hi>Little Giding</hi> had run into exceſs, and incurr'd offence, if the Biſhop had not broken the Snare, which they were preparing for their own feet. For after he had ſpoken well of the Family in the Pulpit, and privately to divers, ſome of them could not ſee when they were well, but aſpir'd to be Tranſcendants above their meaſure. For two Daughters of the Stock came to the Biſhop, and offer'd themſelves to be vailed Virgins, to take upon them the Vow of perpetual Chaſtity, with the Solemnity of the Epiſcopal Bleſſing, and Ratification. Whom he admoniſh'd very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly, that they knew not what they went about. That they had no promiſe to confirm that Grace unto them; that this readineſs, which they had in the preſent, ſhould be in their will, without Repentance, to their Lifes end. Let the younger Women marry, was the beſt Advice, that they might not be led into Temptation And that they might not forget what he taught them, he drew up his Judgment in Three Sheets of Paper, and ſent it them home, that they might dreſs themſelves by that Glaſs, and learn not to think of Humane Nature, above that which it is, a Sea of Flowings, and Ebbings, and of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Inconſtancy.

                  <p n="55">55. In the ſecond place I am to make a ſhort Exhortation unto you, my Brethren of the Clergy. The Effect whereof ſhall be no more than what St. <hi>Hierom</hi> wrote long ago in his Epiſtle to <hi>Nepotian, Qui ſervit eccleſiae, interprete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur primò nomen ſuum.</hi> We that are received into any Place of Office in God's Church, muſt before all other Leſſons, be ſure to underſtand aright the Titles of thoſe Offices, whereunto we are received. And that being once apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Niti eſſe quod dicimur:</hi> To endeavour with all might and main to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we are ſaid to be. We Biſhops are ſaid to be <hi>Viſitatores,</hi> the Temporary Viſitors: You, the Incumbents of Churches, to be <hi>Viſores,</hi> the perpetual Seers of Chriſt's Flock. Our Viſitation is a frequentative Word. <hi>Frequentatio autem non eſt unius actus continuatio, ſed actus interciſi multiplicata repetitio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Groſthead,</hi> (once a famous Biſhop of this See) in one of his Epiſtles. Frequentation doth not import any whole frame, or thread as it were of a continued Act, but the Repetition, and often taking up of a broken, and interrupted Act. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this ſpiritual Flock of Chriſt, being in their nature <hi>individua vaga,</hi> Cattle of a ſcattering, and wandring Condition, there muſt be ſome to have an eye upon them continually, ſome to attend from day to day, beſide thoſe Over-lookers from year to year: Or where the Sheep are many, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of a large extent, from three years to three years, there muſt be <hi>Viſitores,</hi> ſaith <hi>Groſthead,</hi> as well as <hi>Viſitatores;</hi> continual Seers, as well as triennial Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers. And theſe are you, my Brethren of the Clergy, as by your Inſtitutions, Inductions, and Licenſes may appear. Remember therefore in the Fear of God, the Titles of your Offices, that you are thoſe <hi>Videntes in Iſraele,</hi> thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, and immediate Seers of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> You are thoſe that are to ſee to the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſee to the Hearing, to ſee to the reverend and awful Receiving, to ſee to the Manners and Living, to ſee to the Peace, and good Agreeing, and, if you would ſee the Comfort of any thing you ſet, to ſee throughly to the cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing of your People.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. <hi>Primùm omnium fieri orationes,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Above all other Duties of a Chriſtian Man, bring your People as much as you can, to delight in praying. When all is well, and throughly weighed, you ſhall find it the only Duty, whereby a Chriſtian doth moſt reſemble an Angel on Earth, and moſt aſcertain himſelf of being hereafter a Saint in Heav'n. Say what you can (and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not over-reach or ſay too much) in the Commendations of Faith; yet muſt you confeſs it is the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt. And behold Chriſt tells you plainly the Holy Ghoſt it ſelf is the Gift of Devotion, and Praying. And when we have read, and ſtudied, and heard never ſo much, yet <hi>tantum ſcimus, quantum oramus</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay) we may have more Notions, and Ginglings in the Head: but we have no more, true feeling, and pricking Divinity at the Heart, than we have Inclination to Devotion, and Prayer. And of all Prayers none ſo fit for Devotion, as the Prayers of the Liturgy, underſtood by all, and known of all, and therefore putting the poor People to no ſtraining of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but to an intuitive Diſcourſe, as it were of their Wills and Affections to Almighty God. Whereas the long and tedious Prayer of a Preacher (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49492:147"/>where it is crude and extemporary) ſets the Mind of a Country-man on hunting ſo faſt after the unconth Words, which are the Body, that it loſeth all the Mellowneſs, as it were the Ardency, and Devotion, which is the Spirit and Soul of true Prayer. And the Laws do call upon us, to call upon you, to cauſe your Pariſhioners to conn by heart theſe Prayers of the Liturgy, eſpecially the Confeſſion, and Collects. That when they are aſſembled in the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, a Type and Repreſentation of the Church Triumphant, they may not be muſing, and ſtudying (for you do not read that the Saints and Angels do ſo in Heaven) but ſympathizing, and uniting their beſt Affections, with the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Miniſter. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You that are daily Seers of Chriſt's Flock muſt ſee to their Paſture, that is their Hearing. For it is a fond and novel Conceit, to cry up Praying, and with the ſame breath to cry down Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That moſt excellent Form of Prayer, How was it taught but in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sermon? Lord teach us to pray: teaching is a neceſſary Fore-runner of Praying. It is a kind of new Monſter, not heard of in former times, that Preachers ſhould preach againſt Preaching. And yet I muſt correct this Aſſertion. I confeſs it was heard of long ago in the middle Ages, in the time of ignorant and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Popery. <hi>Jo. Gerſon</hi> preaching a Viſitation Sermon before the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> in the Year, 1408. ſaith, that the Clergy of his times bent all their Studies to enable themſelves for Ruling, and Governing, leaving the Mendicants, and the Curates only to ſupply their Preaching. But, as I told you before, this was in the time of the groſs and dull, not of the refined, and quinteſſential Popery. The Dominicans of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Minors of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Oratorions of <hi>France,</hi> and the Jeſuites over all the World are more than ſufficient Preachers: So that this is no Age for us to preach againſt Preaching. I will conclude this Point with a Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> who may be thought partial, but out of a Proſne or Homily, made on purpoſe to be read before the Clergy and Laity in all Viſitations, as I find it in a Book of this Subject written by one <hi>Jo. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcus Pavinus</hi> two hundred Years ago. Saith he, <hi>Fides ſine operibus vana, ſine verbis nulla.</hi> Faith without doing will prove little: but without Preaching it will prove nothing at all. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You that are the Seers of God's People muſt ſee to their due, and awful receiving of the high Myſteries. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> terms it, that Super-coeleſtial Food in the Lord's Supper, which a Chriſtian ought not once to think of, without a ſacred kind of Horror, and Reverence. Here is an Action, I confeſs, wherein you can hardly exceed, either by expreſſing in your ſelves, or by exacting from others, any Circumſtance of Awe and Reverence. I know it is ſafeſt for a Child of the Church, to hold him ſtill to the Canons of the Church. But if in any one thing, ſurely in this, the Canons are rather to be out-bidden, and exceeded, than any way neglected or abated. The Fear, or rather the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of the Peoples falling from extremity to extremity in this caſe, from an extremity of Superſtition (which the ſix Articles had bred in the Hearts, or at leaſtwiſe in the outward Geſtures of Men) to an extremity of Profanation, did much trouble the Magiſtrates in the beginning of the Reformation: You may ſee it clearly in the Letters of the Lord <hi>Protector,</hi> and the reſt of the Council, which are printed in the Book of Martyrs: In the Injunctions of King <hi>Edward:</hi> in the Injunctions of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> And eſpecially in that Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill in force, which enables the King from time to time, to add what Ceremonies, and Decencies he ſhall hold ſitting, for the awful and reverend, as well adminiſtring, as receiving of this heavenly Sacrament. And be not afraid to be accounted herein too too diligent and ceremonious. For we know, that in Myſteries of this high Nature, Ceremonies wait cloſe upon the Subſtances. They may as well ſay (and peradventure will ere long) that an Action of this kind may be done without a Prieſt, as without a troubleſome ſolemn Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>Gerſon</hi> in his Sermon <hi>de Coenâ Domini</hi> ſaith, <hi>Spiritualia ſine temporalibus diu eſſe non poſſe,</hi> that things Spiritual would wax cold without things temporal, was a Proverb cried up by the worſt of the Prelates: but I am ſure that in theſe high Myſteries, <hi>Spiritualia ſine temporalibus eſſe non poſſe:</hi> that the Spiritual Graces (not eſſentially for want of any Vertue in them, but accidentally, by reaſon of ſuch Weakneſs, and Imperfection in us) will fail of their Operations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out temporal Ceremonies, is the Doctrine, not of the worſt, but of the beſt both of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers.</p>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49492:147"/>
57. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You that are the Seers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt ſee into the Lives, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of your People. Which is the ſooner done, if you look well to your own. For it is moſt true on this caſe, what <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vox operum fortiùs ſonat, quàm vox verborum:</hi> the ſound of your Sermon ſtrikes nothing ſo ſhrill in the Ears of your Pariſh, as the ſound of your Life and Converſation. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you do not <hi>Linguâ ſtruere, &amp; manu deſtruere,</hi> as St. <hi>Bern.</hi> ſpeaks, build with the Tongue, and pull down with the Hand. For the Woman's Frump, which <hi>Gerſon,</hi> often cited, writes of, runs as well in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as in other Languages; who being demanded, <hi>Si ſermo factus eſſet,</hi> if the Sermon was done, anſwered, the Sermon was ended, but it was not done. <hi>Dictus quidem eſt ſermo, ſed non factus,</hi> It was ſaid by rote, but it was not done. <hi>Dicunt emm hic ſacerdotes, &amp; non faciunt:</hi> For the Prieſts with them us'd only to ſay, but ſeldom to do, or to perform their Sermons. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If you be thoſe Seers the Canons require, you muſt ſee to your Peoples peace, quietneſs, and good agreeing: That your Neighbours do not ſpend their Bodies, their Minds, their Eſtates, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Bread in brabbles, quarrelling, and Law-ſuiting. Truly I am afraid, that Church-men in <hi>England</hi> have much to anſwer, for the Calamities of the Laity in this kind. Yet have you one by one, by the Pole as it were, in the Preſence of God, and your Mother the Church, promiſed the Biſhop better things at your Ordinations, to wit, that you would, as much as lay in you maintain Peace, and Quietneſs among all Chriſtian People, and eſpecially among thoſe, that were committed to your Charge, your Friends and Neighbours of the Pariſh. And I ſhall not need to ſtrain my Logick to let you ſee, how properly and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially this civil part of a Juſtice of Peace, is woven into the Duty of every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, and Miniſter. For without this Peace-making, you may preach indeed, but in effect to no Pariſh, or Congregation. Becauſe Country-men, diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Law-ſuits, receive little good by you. And being ſometime in the midſt of the Church, are as though they were not there. Let them ſay what they will, it is too true, that in ſaying the Lord's Prayer after you, they pray for Forgiveneſs without forgiving: and too often, God knows, hear your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with little heed, or liſtning. For the poor Souls, all that while the Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs runs, have <hi>Manum</hi> in <hi>Aetolis, animum in Cleopidis,</hi> as it is ſaid of one in <hi>Plutarch:</hi> they have their Eye, it may be, upon the Preacher, but their Mind upon their Attorney, Proctor, or Sollicitor. Yea but you are moſt of you learned Men, and can undeceive your People from theſe Phantaſies. You can ſhew them out of School-men, <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> that Men may go to Law, and yet be in charity. And I muſt be bold to tell you back again, that People will be People for all your diſtinctions, and unleſs you can perſwade them to be in Charity without Law, for all your School-men, <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> the poor Swains will be as they were, in Law without charity. To conclude this Point, where Brother goes to Law with Brother, and Neighbour with Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour about Matters of ſmall moment, I dare not ſay as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, that there is not a wiſe Man, but I will be ſo bold as to ſuſpect, that in that unhappy Town, there is ſcarce a wiſe and conſcientious Miniſter. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If you be Seers of Chriſt's Flock, do as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, that thriving Shepherd, look well to your Sheep, when they are in conceiving. What Colour and Tincture you give them in that hint, you ſhall know them by it for many Years after. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look that that Man ſhould profit at a Sermon, whom you never ſeaſon'd in his Principles of Chriſtianity. A Sermon (ſaith St. <hi>Cyril</hi>) is a good thing, but not ſo condition'd as a Catechiſm. Some Leſſons, forgotten in the one, are but looſe Stones in a Wall, which may be faſten'd again upon a ſecond opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but Ignorance in thoſe Principles is a certain great Stone miſ-lay'd in the Foundation, which hazards the ruine of the whole Building. And again ſays that Father, the erecting of a Chriſtian, is like the planting of a Tree; if you give it not Earth, and rooting at the firſt, you can never repair it with water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pruning. Catechiſm, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> calls it, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the preparing Colours, wherein you muſt dip the People, without the which, for all your Sermons, you ſhall never find them Purple in grain: but pale and wan as long as they live: as ill-grounded Colours uſe to do, ever and anon ſtaining, fading, and decaying I will conclude this Point with an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that grave Divine <hi>Jo. Gerſon,</hi> in a Sermon of his, which I find alſo in a little Book of <hi>Peter de Aliaco, De reformatione eccleſiae. Eccleſiae reformatio debet inchoari à parvulis:</hi> If ever you will reform this Church of Men, you muſt begin with that Church of Children. And
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49492:148"/>this is all that I ſhall ſay unto you in general, my good Brethren of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. For you my honeſt Friends and Neighbours of the Laity, I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you of any Particulars, whereunto you are to anſwer by reaſon of your Offices, but transfer you wholly in that reſpect to thoſe Articles, which you have already receiv'd. But by way of general Exhortation, I am by the ancient Forms of Viſitations in this kind, to recommend unto you, for your Souls good, two principal Inſtructions, the one in point of Belief, the other in point of Practice. In point of Belief, I muſt require your aſſent, without wavering or heſitation, and to continue the remembrance of that Article of your Creed, the Reſurrection to Judgment at the laſt day. And for your Practice, I ſhall deſire you for your own great good, as well in this, as in the Life to come, to meditate day and night upon that Sentence of our Saviours, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>All things whatſoever you would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> For the Reſurrection to Judgment, it was an Article decried by the Heathen, from the firſt hour it came to be preached: it was mock'd at in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time; <hi>Riſus gentium,</hi> the Flout of the Nations in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an univerſal Laughter in St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s time: and the Point of Chriſtianity leaſt brook'd in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time. And therefore, peradventure, enjoyned the Biſhops to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated thus into the People, ever ſince the <hi>Braccaran</hi> Council. But however you may conceive it, perhaps, unneceſſary at this time, or in this Auditory. For, God be praiſed, you are all good Chriſtians, can ſay your Creed, and uſe to repeat it orderly after your Miniſter. That's well done. Yet muſt you know further, that it is not enough to ſay this Article with the Prieſt, unleſs you remember to practiſe it with all the People. This is an Article, not penned for the Tongue alone, but for the Hands alſo of a true Chriſtian. It is not enough to ſay it in Confeſſion, if you act it not in Life and Converſation. Do you therefore continually mind that diſmal ſound, that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Ariſe you Dead, be changed you Living, and come to Judgment.</hi> If you all do ſo, I ſhall confeſs my Exhortation needleſs, and ſhall believe, that you believe indeed the Reſurrection to Judgment. But on the other ſide, if upon every ſlight Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temptation, you ſurrender up the Members of thoſe Bodies of yours, that ſhall riſe to Judgment, as Servants to Sin, your Tongues for Lying, your Hands for Stealing, your Brains for Cheating, your Hearts for Malicing, your Feet for running to ſhed Blood: if you make the Members of Chriſt the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an Harlot: if you have all the reaſon in the World, upon the ſounding of that Trump, to call for the Mountains to fall upon you, and the Hills to cover you, that you may not come to Judgment, I muſt tell you, that ſhewing your Faith no better by your Works (as St. <hi>James</hi> bids you) I may believe that you can rehearſe; but I cannot believe, that you do mind or believe (at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe while you are in <hi>flagranti crimine,</hi> in the heighth, and meridian of your Sins) the Reſurrection to Judgment. It is not enough for you to believe, but alſo with all your might and power to live the Reſurrection to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. And were you but once paſt this firſt, you would quickly take out your ſecond Leſſon, whatſoever you would that Men ſhould do unto you, ſo to do unto them, it being impoſſible for a Chriſtian Soul to do otherwiſe, that were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and throughly ſeaſon'd, with a practical Belief of the Reſurrection to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Sentence, and Rule of Juſtice, and Charity, found out of purpoſe by our Saviour Chriſt for plain and ſimple Men, that are able to bear away no longer diſcourſe, to direct them to live peaceably in this Life, and happily in that to come, if you can remember, and put in uſe that one Sentence, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>Do as you would be done unto.</hi> Why then, will ſome ſay to me, you are come to this Viſitation to bring us nothing, or almoſt nothing, a ſhort Sentence to make a Poſie in a Ring. O for all that do not diſreſpect the Littleneſs. It is <hi>Sententia bracteata,</hi> a Sentence to be written in Plates of Gold. And heretofore it hath been written in the Palaces of Kings and Emperors. It is a Sentence that procur'd eaſe with <hi>Anton. Pius,</hi> and reſpect to the Chriſtians with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Severus,</hi> as Hiſtorians report. <hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> indeed makes ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether that Emperor learn'd this Sentence from the Jews, or from the Chriſtians. But we make no queſtion at all, but he ſuck'd it with his Milk from his Mother <hi>Mammaea,</hi> the Scholar of that great <hi>Origen,</hi> as <hi>Caſaubon</hi> notes upon that Author. I tell you (dearly <hi>Beloved</hi>) <hi>Do as you would be done unto,</hi> is a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which once put in practice, would make an end of a World of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49492:148"/>nay of all the Sentence; in this World, and peradventure of thoſe we fear in the World to come. You are many of you afraid of the Eccleſiaſtical, and many more (as you have more reaſon) of the Temporal Courts. Your Purſes may ſuffer in the one: and your Perſons, beſide your Purſes in the other. And yet do all the bitter Sentences of either Court iſſue from this Spring, from this only Spring, that either the Plaintiff, or the Defendant, or the Witneſs, or the Advocate, or the Proctor, or at the furtheſt the Judge himſelf hath quite forgotten this little Sentence, to do as he would be done unto. Yea, but is not this Univerſity Learning, and above the apprehenſion of a plain Man? No; St. <hi>Chryſ.</hi> ſays you need not repair to any Man to learn it. You have it <gap reason="foreign">

As for Example, Would you know whether you may not, <hi>parle droict de bien-ſeance,</hi> as the <hi>Trench</hi> Maſters uſe to ſay, by a certain Point of Law, which I may call your better fitting and accommodation, make bold with your Neighbours Goods in ſuch a caſe, with his Lands in ſuch a caſe, his Fame in ſuch a caſe, his Wiſe in ſuch a caſe, or any thing that is his, as you will make the caſe? And yet do all theſe Feats cleanly and handſomely, with a colour at the leaſt of ſome Law, or Equity? You need not ſtudy <hi>Ulpian, Bartolus,</hi> or <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in this Point. You need not turn over the Reports of the Law; or the Year-books of the Judges. Unclaſp only the Book in your own Boſom, in your own Conſcience, and mark well what is written therein. You have your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer argued there without Judge, or Counſellor. Do you find it there regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, that upon the putting of the like caſe, your ſelf would be content to have your own Goods, your own Lands, your own Fame, your own Wiſe, or any thing that is yours taken from you? and withal to make the Matter a little worſe, and more picquant, to have a flouriſh of Law or Equity caſt upon the Caſe, to bereave you of that poor, and laſt Comfort, the Pity, and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Beholders? If you find there no ſuch caſe reported from yourſelves, moot it not upon any other: but liſten unto Chriſt's little Sentence, and do as you would be done to. Yea, but perhaps I would be done to in my Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what you will not admit, I ſhould do to another as in the Caſe of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or Adultery; ſhall I do in that caſe, what I deſire to be done to me? And therefore the Rule is not ſo ſafe as it is repreſented. Yea, but then if you will any thing, as this Rule would have you to will, you muſt will <hi>voluntate rationali &amp; diſcretà,</hi> ſaith <hi>Alexander Ales,</hi> with a rational and diſcreet will, and then you ſhall not miſcarry. Or you muſt do as you would have Men do, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, non bruta,</hi> as you would have Men, and not Beaſts do unto you, ſaith <hi>Albertus magnus.</hi> But thoſe that will do unto you any ſuch filthineſs, as you ſpeak of, are as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them, <hi>Men after the manner of Beaſts.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all your Actions whatſoever, remember ſtill this little Sentence, as you deſire to avoid thoſe other Sentences, ſome in this Life, and ſome in the Life to come.

Thoſe of young and tender years were much in his Care, as appeared, that he ſeldom travelled, but Notice being given before, he ſtaid at ſome Town or Village, to confirm ſuch as were but even paſt children, to lay his Hands on them, and to bleſs them, and did it oſtener than the 60 Canon requires: An ancient and an admirable Order, when ſuch were preſented as were before made ready by being exactly catechized. And for Childrens ſakes he liſten'd much, what good Schoolmaſters he had in his Dioceſs, that bare the irkſome and tedious Burden, to rear up a good Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for Church and State; ſuch he valued, and thought their Place was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than is uſually given them in the World.

Our Biſhop had the opportunity to conſecrate Churches new re-ediſied, and Chappels erected, which he perform'd with much Magnificence and Ceremony, that the Houſes of God, his Houſes of Prayer, might be had in a venerable regard. Nothing was more obſerv'd in that Performance, than that at the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of a Chappel, belonging to the Manſion-place of Sir <hi>Goſtwick</hi> in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire,</hi> the Knight's Son and Heir being born deaf and dumb, and continuing in that defect, no ſooner did the Biſhop alight, and come into the Houſe, but the young Gentleman kneeled down, and made ſigns to the Biſhop, that he craved his Bleſſing, and had it with a paſſionate Embrace of Love. A ſweet Creature he was, and is, of rare Perſpicacity of Nature, rather of rare Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, whoſe Behaviour, Geſtures, and zealous Signs have procur'd and allow'd him admittance to Sermons, to Prayers, to the Lord's Supper, and to the Marriage of a Lady of a great and prudent Family, his Underſtanding ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as much in all his motions, as if his Tongue could articulately deliver his Mind. Nor was any of the Prelacy of <hi>England</hi> more frequented than this Lord, for two things: Firſt, by ſuch as made Suit unto him, to compound their Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, that they might not come to the chargeable and irkſome attendance of the Courts of Law. <hi>Averſos ſolitus componere amicos,</hi> Horat. <hi>Serm.</hi> 5.

This was <hi>Kilvert,</hi> a vexatious Proſecutor of many in the Court of <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> for the King, whoſe Lineaments are drawn out in the Ninth Book of <hi>Apul. Metam.

All that I have drawn up of his Paſtoral Behaviour was ſeen in the Day-light; therefore, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whom he had commended, ſo I may with Modeſty apply it to my Subject; <hi>If I have boaſted any thing of him to you, I am not aſhamed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.

Having delivered up the Great Seal, from the firſt day that he removed to <hi>Bugden,</hi> all Promiſes were broken, which gave him Aſſurance of Countenance and Safety; and the place to which he was bidden to go, as to a Sanctuary, aſſorded him no more ſhelter, than an Arbour in the Winter againſt a Shower of Rain. Therefore to keep off Miſtakes, be it noted, as to the time, it was the ſame, wherein he lived ſo like a Biſhop, and wherein he ſuffer'd ſo like a Confeſſor. But Method di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth thoſe Troubles by themſelves, like Tares gathered from the good Wheat, and bound in their own Bundles. Some are greater, practis'd upon no Subject before, nor fit to be done hereafter. Some are leſſer matters, yet not unworthy my Hand: When they are diſpoſed Limb by Limb, and in order as they were done, there will be much of them (I would they had been leſs) and be known to be enforced, without Shame of the World) with ſo much Wrong and Rancour that an indifferent Reader will depoſe, there needs no Fiction nor Colour, to make them worſe than they were. Thoſe that were outdone in the firſt place, were outgone by them that came after: <hi>Quid prima querar? Quid ſumma gemam? Pariter cuncla deſlere juvat. Sene. Her.

It was his ill luck to be feared, becauſe of the great Powers of his Mind, whom none had cauſe to fear, ſince he never fought Revenge. Then they ſaw he would ſtand upright, and never ſtoop, after they had loaded his Back with ſo many Burthens, which made them obſtinate to proceed, and labour in vain to cruſh out that which was not Wind, but Spirit.

That's the Goal I drive to: And thoſe Circuitions which are brought in for thoſe Applications ſake, will make that, which might be ſhut up in a little, ſwell into a Volume. <hi>Caſaubon</hi> gives us this Warning of <hi>Polybius,</hi> in his rare Preface before him: <hi>Ita narrat ut moneat: Perſonam hiſtorici cum aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit</hi> Polybius, <hi>non in totum exuit philoſophi.

For an entrance, I take my method from a wiſe Artiſt, concerning the long and dangerous Adventures of his <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to ſearch into the Cauſe, <hi>Quo numine laeſo,</hi> which way it came about, ſince there was no man living, whoſe Harm this Biſhop wiſh'd, that he could never find his Peace and Proſperity again, when once he had loſt them? Why, principally I caſt it upon his Sins; What Man is without them? And his were not many, but thoſe ſome were great ones; a lofty Spirit, whoſe motion tended upward, reſtleſs to climb to Fower and Honour; And not one among an hundred of great Aſpirers that live to ſee quiet days. And this was joyn'd with too much Fire in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Anger, in which Mood indeed, which is ſtrange, he would reaſon excellently, and continue it in the very <hi>Euro-clydon</hi> of his Choler; as the <hi>Low Germans</hi> are moſt cunning at a Bargain, when they are more than half tippled. But in ſuch an evil extaſie of the Mind, words would fall from him, or from any, which pleaſed not Men, and were hateful to GOD: Let theſe ſtand for the Fore-ſinger, that points to the cauſe of his bitter Encounters. Every man's evil <hi>Genius,</hi> that haunts him, is his own Sin, which wipes not out any paat of the Good which hath been written of him before. The ſame man appears not the ſame, but another in ſome miſcarriages. <hi>Polybius, lib.</hi> 16. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Philip</hi> the Son of <hi>Demetrius</hi> very much, and anon diſpraiſes him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles it thus: <gap reason="foreign">

And it is finely ſaid in the Eſſay, That <hi>the good things belonging to Proſperity are to be wiſh'd, but the good things belonging to Adverſity are to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> This being a true and a divine Sentence, That Sin, and nothing elſe, makes the Stock of every man's Comfort to dye in the Ground, as <hi>Job</hi> loves to ſpeak, it hangs well together, that God knows beſt in what manner to puniſh every man's Sin; who gave this Prelate great Favour with King <hi>James,</hi> but took King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Affection from him. The Lord <hi>H. Howard,</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Judicious Aſtrology,</hi> turns theſe Turnings into this uſe: Change of Princes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49492:151"/>breeds change of Favourites; but they that are once dear to God, are ever dear to him. I proteſt to the Reader, that Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> could not be brought to believe, that the King bad any Willingneſs in his own Heart to afflict and bruiſe him, but that ſuch things came from the Infuſion of thoſe that had too much of His Majeſty's Ear, and by Importunity tranſported him from the lenity of his own Judgment. And when the greateſt Sorrows compaſs'd him about, he deſired only to be brought to the King, with the advantage of half an hour, to declare his Injuries and Innocency, ſo much he perſwaded himſelf that he was right in his gracious Opinion. He knew him to be a Prince Pious and Juſt: He preſum'd his Noble Soul would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get with what Succeſs his Counſel and Contrivance removed all Obſtructions, to bring him as ſafe out of <hi>Spain</hi> as he deſir'd: He had received a Promiſe of everlaſting Love and Kindneſs, for tracing the Jugglings of <hi>Inoihoſa,</hi> and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to light, whereby the dangerous Jealouſies of the old King were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and His Highneſs received ſweetly into his Father's Boſom. An honeſt man could not be ſuſpicious, that the memory of ſuch faithful Service was loſt. But ſtanders-by thought they ſaw more than the Biſhop did, who might ſooneſt be miſtaken in the Criſis of his own Diſeaſe, becauſe flattering Hope is but a waking Dream. If the King had not been pleaſed in his Sufferings, why did he let them ſwell ſo far? As his Royal Name was uſed in all, ſo his Good liking went to all, or after ſo many Bruiſings, Gentleneſs had not been forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Inſtruments next to be nam'd were moſt guilty of the Violence; yet the higheſt Power did more than permit and look on. As it is the Sun that ſcorcheth in <hi>July,</hi> and not the Dog-Star; it is a popular Error, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives as if that Star, when it roſe, did cauſe the heat of the Weather: Yet ſtill the Biſhop would not think his Caſe was in that extremity, that the King's Anger was in it: For as it is ſpoken of <hi>Padre-Paulo,</hi> in his Life, That he was leſs ſenſible of Fear than ordinarily men uſe to be; ſo this man would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright himſelf with nothing, leaſt of all, with that which was cloſe and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and would often ſay in a Frolick, That <hi>Miſeries are like the Plague, if you fear them, you draw them to you.</hi> But, which will give great light to the Subject now handled, once he was ſtartled at a word which fell ſuddenly from the King, in a few weeks after the death of his Father; one told him, that came from the French Court, as it is in the <hi>Cabal, p.</hi> 203. That the Spaniſh Ambaſſador ſpake openly there, when the Marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> was to be finiſh'd, That <hi>he could not have two Wives, for their Infanta was ſurely his:</hi> To which the King replied, <hi>There are ſome</hi> Engliſh, <hi>as well as</hi> Spaniards, <hi>that are of that Opinion.</hi> Which being carried from the King's Mouth to this Biſhop, he ſaid with a low Voice, <hi>I know no ſuch; but if he mean me, it will be the worſe for me while I live.</hi> From which let a wiſe man find out what he can, ſo he find no more than he ſhould. Either this, or ſome ſuch hard Conceit, lay hid in the King's Stomach, againſt a moſt deſerving Church-man. And every Age had ſome ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at which it was aſtoniſh'd. No Hiſtory ſpeaks any ill of the Empreſs <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> but that ſhe could not agree with <hi>Chryſoſtom. Harry</hi> the Seventh, one of our beſt Kings, was very iniquous to Lord <hi>Stanly,</hi> one of his beſt Subjects: Not a better Lady than Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor a better Peer than the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> yet Stateſmen thought that neither were ſafe while the other lived. The Hand of the Juſt may be heavy againſt the Juſt, by woful Experience: The greateſt Claw-backs of the Pope confeſs, <hi>Though he cannot err,</hi> ſay they, <hi>in an Opinion of Faith, he may err in the miſtake of a Perſon; as to canonize a wrong Saint, and excommunicate a right one.</hi> Which ſhews, that my Conſcience is in no ſuch ſtreight, to derogate from the Glory of a moſt bleſſed King, becauſe his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, darken'd by human Error, lighted upon a <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> a faultleſs perſon.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. The Duke of <hi>Buck.</hi> (Who knows it not?) was the Biſhop's ſtrong and proteſted Enemy, who vowed, that of all he had given him, (but with as much good liking of K. <hi>James</hi> as of his Lordſhip) he would leave him nothing; who when he threatned an ill turn, had Power to do it, and did not often forget it: Which made the Biſhop ſhelter himſelf under the King's Grace and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, of which he did never ceaſe to have a ſtrong Perſwaſion, begging, as it is <hi>Cabal. p.</hi> 109, for God's ſake, and for his bleſſed Father's ſake, that His Majeſty would allay the Duke's cauſeleſs Diſpleaſure, who was ſo little ſatisfied with any thing that he could do or ſuffer, that he had no means left to appeaſe his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but Prayers to God, and his Sacred Majeſty. In the mean time that one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49492:151"/>Foe made the diſtreſſed Party get many Friends; like <hi>Rabirius</hi>'s Fortune in <hi>Tully, Nihil aeque ac judicis accrbitas profurt;</hi> who had nothing to help him ſo much, as that <hi>Caeſar</hi> did hunt after his Ruin with ſo much violence. Now that which made the Duke's Defiances grow fiercer day by day, was not the Biſhop's ſtoutneſs, (to which he was ſufficiently prone) for he had ſought him with all Submiſſion, which was on this ſide of deſpicable Baſeneſs: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being ſent to for his Opinion, both by his Grace's Mother, and his moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſollicitous Friends, he had faithfully expreſſ, That he did not like the ways wherein he magnified himſelf to ſerve the King: Who did not foreſee the Envy that his Magniloquence bred, ranting it ſometimes, That <hi>he would make His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty the greateſt Monarch in</hi> Europe. I doubt not but his Head did work about it, and was ſo noble, that he would have died to effect it: And ſome that faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon him with all obſequiouſneſs, did ſeem to admire him in it; as the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> among others; ſuch are the Contents of his Letters, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 297. <hi>I hope nothing ſhall light upon your Lordſhip, but what you deſerve, the which, to my knowledge, is of more Value and Eſteem, than any man in the World could, or ever can merit from this Kingdom.</hi> The Biſhop, that would not concur to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, by miſguidance of Flattery, who had been Copartner with King <hi>James</hi> in his Preferments, ſung quite to another Tune: He liked not his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations againſt <hi>Cales,</hi> but preſaged a diſhonourable Return; and preſt that Maxim home to divert him from it, <hi>That a King muſt make himſelf ſure in the Love of his own People at home, before he bid War abroad to ſuch a rich and mighty Nation.</hi> Next, the ſecond Parliament being ſummoned, and this Biſhop deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what was beſt for the Duke's abearing in it, he reſolv'd it to thoſe Friends that ask'd it, <hi>His beſt way will be, not to come near it; for it will be impoſſible for him to cloſe with this Parliament, who, contrary to my Advice, offended the former, and broke it up: Let him remove himſelf, by ſome great Embaſſage, till the firſt Seſſion be ended, into</hi> Germany <hi>if he will, as far as</hi> Vienna, <hi>if he dare truſt the King of</hi> Spain's <hi>greateſt Friend and neareſt Ally.</hi> This was diſreliſh'd, for they of E. <hi>Buck.</hi> Counſel, rather than ſend him ſo far from the King, would hazard him in the Parliament, in which they thought they were ſtrong enough, by the Party they had made, to keep him from all Offence, as well in his Honour as in his Perſon. The Biſhop perſiſted to remove them from their Confidence; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more fallacious than ſuch Expectation. Many that are beſpoken, and promiſe fair, are quite alter'd when they are mingled with their fellow-Judges in the Houſe. As <hi>Matchiavel</hi> ſays it was a <hi>Florentine</hi> Proverb, <hi>Populus alurm animum in foro, alium in Senatu habet,</hi> De Rep. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 47. All that he ſaid fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as right as ever <hi>Lucas Guaricus</hi> drew up a Scheme of Predictions; for, that Parliament diſcharged ſuch a Volley of Complaints againſt his Lordſhip, that the Votes of the Declinators could not be heard for the noiſe. And his Grace pluck'd hard for Peace and Popularity with the Commons, but could not encounter them. But, what a ſtruggling he kept with his hard Deſtiny, to be enflamed the more againſt the much abuſed Biſhop, becauſe his Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were ſo prophetical! A good Chaplain would have told him, that God's Wiſdom is ſeen by his Fore-warnings, and his Goodneſs in giving them. Nor was it Juſtice to account him a Foe, becauſe he was wiſer than an ordinary Friend: But, who had the worſt of it in the end? Or rather, who had the worſt of it from the very beginning? <hi>Miſerior eſt qui ſuſcipit in ſe ſcelus, quàm qui alterius facinus ſubire cogitur, Tul. Phil.</hi> II. He is more miſerable that doth a Wrong, than he that ſuffers it. Yet, by the Mediation of wiſe men, the Duke continued not full two years more in this Uncharitableneſs; for he promiſed, at a ſecret Meeting, two months before he died, to repoſſeſs the Biſhop in Favour, and deſign'd a time for the open profeſſion of it; ſo that the Sun of his Life did not go down in Wrath: And God did appear in it, <hi>who will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever,</hi> Pſal. 103. <hi>v</hi> 9.</p>

Of all men, Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was the Party whoſe Enmity was moſt tedious, and moſt ſpightful againſt his great Benefactor <hi>Lincoln.</hi> He batter'd him with old and new Contrivances fifteen years: His very Dreams were not without them, as they are enrolled in his Memorials, drawn out with his own Hand: I will touch that Fault, that great Fault, with a gentle Hand, becauſe of that Good which was in him; becauſe in other things, I believe, for my part, he was better than he was commonly thought; becauſe his Death did extinguiſh a great deal of Envy. I meet with him in his worſt Action that ever he did, and cannot ſhun it: If I ſhould draw him in purpoſely to defame him, now
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49492:152"/>he is at reſt, I were more ſacrilegious than if I rob'd his Tomb. <hi>Qui cineres at<expan>

                  <p>It was time for him to ſupplicate for this Juſtice, for he knew that his Name was abuſed in the King's Bed-chamber, with continual Scandals; Lyes that were untraceable in their ground and original. And he had reaſon to ſuſpect, that of ſuch Stuff there was more than came to his Knowledge: But Jealouſies had better ſigh themſelves away, than crave Redreſs from Princes; againſt ſuch ſecret Stingings there's no prevention, but great Fear; for they that go a Batt-fowling in the dark, to ſeek matter of Crimination, and inject miſtruſtful and uncharitable Reports day by day, to undermine the man they aim at, fetch
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49492:152"/>that about by many Fly-blowings, which they cannot do at once: As a little Sand gathers into a body by many Tydes, and in time becomes a Shelf, and at laſt a Bar, or Quick-ſand, able to drown the beſt Frigat. It is fit that Kings ſhould have Intelligence, but upon the Peril of him that brings not a Truth. It is fit they ſhould know their Subjects, but not in a falſe Glaſs. He that abuſeth a Kings Ears, robs not from the Sheaf, or from the Stack, but from the Seed-corn, which is treble Thievery. A man that ſpreads Libels corrupts the People: A Delator that whiſpers invented Tales into his Soveraign, is worſe, for he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts him that is worth Ten thouſand of the People. Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi>'s ſweet Paſſage is worth the learning; That <hi>it is good to be Led, not to be Carried by the Ears:</hi> That is, it is good to uſe the Ear, not to truſt to it. Theſe Blob-tales, when they could find no other News to keep their Tongues in motion, laid open our Biſhop for a Malignant, becauſe he gave Entertainment at his Board, to ſuch as carried a Grudge to the Lord Duke's Proſperity; who, if ſuch, came in their courſe to his Houſe upon old acquaintance, but upon no factious deſign, that ever was proved.

Yet well-fare Circumſpection, and Innocency, that theſe privy Suggeſtions went out one by one, like Sparks that fall upon dank and unprepared matter. More Harm was expected to come from a Commiſſion of Thirteen, who had Order from the Duke to meet together, to ſift into every part and paſſage of the Biſhop's Tranſactions, and to collect what was culpable, and would bear Cenſure in the <hi>Kings-bench, Star-chamber,</hi> or <hi>High Court of Parliament.</hi> The chiefeſt of the Thirteen in Place, was Sir <hi>Rob. Heath</hi> Attorny-General, but an honeſt man, and a fair dealer. This was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with that little noiſe, that for a good ſpace the vigilant Biſhop was not awaked with it, till ſome of his old Officers broke it to him, who were called, and interrogated upon ſome of his Decrees and Diſpatches. Sir <hi>Anth. Welden</hi> (I borrow the Teſtimony of an Enemy) expreſſeth it thus, <hi>p.</hi> 174. <hi>His Rum was determin'd, not upon any known Crime, but upon Circumſtances and Examinations, to pick out Faults committed in his whole Life-time.</hi> And, as it were to confront the Tribunal of this unuſual Inquiſition, the Biſhop writes to His Majeſty, juſt at the time when it ſate, <hi>That no uſe might be made of his Sacred Name, to wound him; but that he craved no Protection againſt any other Accuſer or Accuſation whatſoever, Cab. p.</hi> 118. See the ſtoutneſs of a clear Conſcience: He knew how the Buſhes were beaten, and how the Beagle ranged the Field for Game. He heard the Cry of the Blood-hounds, that noſed the Ground where he trod. <hi>Qui ſi non cecidit, potuit cecidiſſe videri,</hi> Metam. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. But all was well; that Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ended at <hi>Labour in vain;</hi> not as the old Emblem is, to go about to <hi>make a Black-moor white,</hi> but to make him that was White to appear like a Black-moor. That Inquiſition could find no Fault in him, but it is eaſie to find Fault with that Inquiſition. A Magiſtrate muſt try him that is accuſed for a Delinquent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Judge; but he muſt not try how he may make a Delinquent, becauſe he is a Father. There was nothing good in that privy Search, but that the Patient was no Patient; and, that his Enemies lookt far into him, and found nothing which they fought for. Like them that delve into the bottom of the Sea, and fetch up Sponges; ſo <hi>The Righteous ſhall hold on his way; and he that hath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job 17.9.</p>
                  <p n="68">68. Neither did it deject the Biſhop to be made a Gazing-ſtock by Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. The King's Coronation, and his ſecond Parliament, began together at <hi>Candlemas;</hi> and he was warned by Letter to ſerve at neither. A Coronation being uſually accompanied with a General Pardon, ſhould have caſt a Frown upon none: Yet his Place was not granted him, to do his Homage among the Spiritual Lords, nor to aſſiſt the Archbiſhop, at the Sacred Parts of that high Solemnity, as Dean of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> It is arbitrary, and at the King's Pleaſure,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49492:153"/>to range that Royal Ceremony as he likes beſt; to follow former Preſidents, or wave them; to intruſt what Miniſters he likes, in the Management, except ſome Tenure or old Charter give admittance to ſome perſons without exception. Otherwiſe in the very principal performance, ſays venerable <hi>Saravia, De Chriſt.

He that was ſo kind to diſpoſe who ſhould keep the Crown, did mean, That the King ſhould not wear it without his Leave and Courteſie. And let it be his Fault to be impertinent, and to meddle with the keeping of Royal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that did not concern him: What is their Crime, that have carried them quite away, both Crown, and Scepter, and Robes, from their ancient Sacrary?

But, what's the matter that I have almoſt loſt my ſelf in this Loſs? I was about to tell, that Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> muſt not wait in the Honourable Place of the Dean, at the Coronation, but in a Complement he was ſent to Name one of the Twelve Prebendaries, to ſerve in his room. This was deviſed to fret him, and to catch a Waſp in a Water-trap. Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was a Prebendary at this time, and the Subſtitute intended at Court, to act in the Coronation. If <hi>Lincoln</hi> ſhould Name him, he had been laugh'd at, for preferring the man that thruſt himſelf by;—And if he did not Name him, and no other, he had been check'd for inſcribing one of a leſſer Order in the Church, before a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to ſo great a Service. But his Wit ſaved him from either Inconvenience: He ſent the Names of his Twelve Brethren to the King, reſigning it up to His Majeſty to elect whom he pleaſed. A Submiſſion which <hi>Climacus</hi> would call <hi>Sepulchrum voluntatis,</hi> a dead Obedience, without a ſenſible Concurrence. And he ſtirred no more, either by Challenge or Petition, to do that eminent Office of the Deanery in his own Perſon, but ſays in his Letter to the King, That he ſubmitted to that Sequeſtration; for ſo he calls it. It is wiſe to ſit down when a man can trouble no Body but himſelf, if he moves.

Other Reaſons ſway'd this circumſpect man, to carry it with no ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, that he was not called to the Parliament: But to do Honour to the King, and to ſave his own Right (nay, the common Right of Peers) he took a middle way between Crouching and Contumacy. He call'd it His Majeſty's Gracious Pleaſure, (and was in earneſt, that he eſteem'd it ſo) to ſpare his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at the Parliament; but he expoſtulated to have a Writ of Summons (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to no Priſoners, no, nor condemned Peers, in the late Reign of his bleſſed Father, <hi>Cab. p.</hi> 118.) that accordingly he might make a Proxy; which he could not do, the Writ not receiv'd.

                        <p>IT becometh me, of all the reſt of your Subjects, having been ſo infinitely obliged to Your Majeſty, to caſt my ſelf down at your Feet, and oppoſe no Interpretation Your Majeſty ſhall be pleaſed to make of any of my Actions whatſoever: Howbeit, before the receipt of my Lord Keeper's Letter, that I had carried my abſence from the Parliament with as much Humility and Reſpect to Your Majeſty, as ever Subject of <hi>England</hi> did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Soveraign. The delivery of my Proxy to the firſt Biſhop Your Majeſty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I excuſed mannerly to Your Majeſty, but with a private Reaſon to my Lord Keeper, not to be replied againſt. The ſecond Lord Biſhop is directly uncapable of that part of my Proxy, which concerneth the Houſe of Convocation. Theſe two Lords, now named by Your Majeſty, are without exception: Were it not divulged in the Upper Houſe, that I am to have a Proctor thruſt upon me, againſt all Preſidents; and that I dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, becauſe I am guilty of (I know not what) Crimes? When I wrote unto Your Majeſty humbly, as became me, my Letter, deliver'd by Your Majeſty to the Duke, was publiſh'd by him, as an Effect of a dejected and guilty Conſcience. When I ſhall obey your Majeſty in the diſpoſal of my Proxy, my L. Duke may uſe that Act alſo, not only to ſerve himſelf (which I deſire he ſhould with all my Heart) but principally to wound and deprave me. Diſpleaſures of Favourites, which are without Ground, are alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out End. <hi>Hoc habent animi magnâ fortunâ inſolentes, quos laeſerunt, &amp; oderunt.</hi> His Grace hath told Your Majeſty, that I call'd the Chapter at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> againſt the12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>to have a Colour to come to the Parliament; whereas the Chapter is appointed to be held at that day, by the Statutes of the College. He hath told Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that I held correſpondence with the Earl of <hi>Briſtol; </hi> from whom I have received neither Letter or Meſſage theſe two years, as I will anſwer it with my Head. He hath told Your Majeſty (and all the World beſide) that I ſtirred the Lower Houſe at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and have my ſecret Inſtruments againſt his Grace even in this Parliament. If he be able to prove either of theſe Charges, I will loſe not only my Biſhoprick (which his Grace hath threatned, againſt the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, to take away from me) but withal my Life alſo. My Caſe (<hi>Dread Soveraign</hi>) is miſerable, and the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not mine alone. Your Commands come immediately in your own Name, and therefore muſt be readily obeyed. Your Graces are ſtreined through the Hands of another, and therefore are either not at all, (as in my Caſe) or not ſo purely, and ſincerely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And when Your Majeſty puniſheth, (pardon a Truth plainly deliver'd, which you were wont to love, Dread Soveraign) you do it not like your ſelf, becauſe you do it not your ſelf. A King, be he never ſo ſevere, when he chaſteneth his Subjects, doth puniſh them with Juſtice, becauſe they are his Subjects; but yet with Mercy, becauſe they are his own. An angry Lord, that makes bold with the King's Authority, lays on Load, as upon Men, and that without Mercy, as upon the Subjects of another. It was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Vinius Galba's</hi> Favourite, and it is moſt worthy Your Majeſties remembrance, <hi>Minore licentiâ graſſatus eſſet</hi> T. Vinius, <hi>ſi ipſe imperaſſet: Nunc &amp; ſubjectos nos habuit, tanquam ſuos; &amp; viles, ut alienos.</hi> And in my caſe for the preſent, if I ſhould ſtand upon my Right, and refuſe Your Majeſty, I muſt expect all Severity, becauſe another hath your Rod. If I ſhall yield and obey, I muſt hope for no acceptation, becauſe another holds the Garland. And for this other, if I ſeek him, my Letters are ſhew'd, and I am made foul and guilty: If I let him alone, I am deprived of the Sun and the Rain, the ordinary Graces and Influences of Your Majeſty. Laſtly, When I know, and all the World beſide, that I ſink only under the cauſeleſs Malice of a Subject, yet doth that great man waſh his Hands, and publiſh (to the vexation of my honeſt Soul) That I lye buried under the immediate Hatred of my Soveraign. And therefore, with an humble Proteſtation againſt Fear of Puniſhment, which cannot fall upon my Innocency, or Hope of Favour, ſure to be kept back by the Greatneſs of my Adverſary; I do, out of religious Duty, and mere Obedience to Your Sacred Majeſty, and no other Reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, ſend this Proxy for my L. of<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which I humbly beſeech Your Sacred Majeſty to direct not to be ſent to his Lordſhip, until ſuch time as there ſhall be Uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But it may be his Grace gave the other the more Liberty to write what he would, becauſe he had ſtopt his Mouth from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Parliament. Which was a Benefit: For <hi>Athenagoras</hi> was not deprived of <hi>Athens,</hi> but <hi>Athens</hi> was deprived of <hi>Athenagoras.</hi> There is much Weight in the worth of one man: And much might have been expected from one that was ſo active, and well verſed to ſtop the Breaches of Contentions, if he had been uſed and ſought to. The Duke was ill advis'd, to keep them out of the Houſe by threes and fours, of whoſe Oppoſition he was jealous, and could not tye up their Tongues, that fell upon him by hundreds. Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> Sir <hi>T. Wentworth,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Philips,</hi> were prick'd to be High-Sheriffs of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, York, Somerſet Shires,</hi> to put them into Incapacity to be Members of the Commons-Houſe. What ſaid our Biſhop to it, being in a merry Pin, when one told him, For certain he ſhould be reſtrain'd from his Place in the Houſe of Peers? <hi>What then? Am I made High-Sheriff of</hi> Huntington-ſhire? <hi>Such minute Policies are frivolous, and may ſerve among Huntſmen, to ſave the life of a Hare, when a ſew of the old Dogs are tied up, and not brought into the Field.</hi> But were there now enow able men in both Houſes, though half a ſcore were ſpar'd, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Game without changing? This was that Parliament, that ſpent the beſt part of 18 Weeks in drawing up a Charge, and proſecuting it againſt the L. Duke. What ſhould this Biſhop have done there, being neither fit for the offenſive nor defenſive part? How far he was from intending to offend, he expreſt in a Paſſage about his Proxy, that he deſired the Duke ſhould ſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by it with all his Heart. And I heard him my ſelf diſpute it with one of the ſharpeſt Antagoniſts of his Grace, in the time of the Seſſion, and ſtagger him, That it was the ſafeſt way for the Publick Good, to deſiſt from that vexatious Charge with this ſubtle Similitude; That if a Beaſt were got into a Field of Wheat, if the Neighbors ran in, and hunted it about with their Dogs, they would tread down more Corn than five Beaſts could devour, if they were let alone. So, to ſpend ſo much Time and Pains upon a Charge againſt one Peer, did let Opportunity run by, wherein many good Laws might be made, and loſt the Common-wealth more than it could gain by this Impeachment. Neither would he diſpleaſe the King, to appear againſt a Lord that was unto him in a manner his whole Court. <hi>Una fuit nemus arbor,</hi> Ovid. And as <hi>Illuſtrius</hi> the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorean</hi> records it, that <hi>Tyberius</hi> the Emperor wrote his Letter thus for <hi>Polemo</hi> the Philoſopher, <gap reason="foreign">

And as <hi>Lanfrank</hi> charged one of his Predeceſſors, <hi>Remigius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln, Quod officio emerat Epiſcopatum:</hi> So the World would have cenſur'd this Prelate, that he kept his Place by Service; <hi>Simony,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> calls it. And with what Safety and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he could appear, let one Paſſage demonſtrate: The Duke demanded, that the Attorney-General might plead for him, in the Houſe of Peers, againſt the Charge tranſmitted by the Commons; which was oppoſed, becauſe the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney was one of the King's Learned Council, and ſworn to plead in Cauſes concerning the King, and not againſt them: And the King is ſuppoſed to be ever preſent in the noble Senate of the Lords. It was rejoyn'd, That His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would diſpenſe with the Attorney's Oath: It came to be a Caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and was referr'd to the Biſhop's Learning. Some of them judged for the Duke, that this was not an Aſſertory-Oath, which admits no alteration, but a Promiſſory-Oath, from which Promiſe the King, if he pleas'd, might releaſe his Learned Counſel. Biſhop <hi>Felton,</hi> a devout man, and one that feared God, very learned, and a moſt Apoſtolical Overſeer of the Clergy whom he gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, argued, That ſome Promiſſory-Oaths indeed might be relaxed, if great cauſe did occur; yet not without great cauſe, leſt the Obligation of ſo ſacred a thing as an Oath ſhould be wantonly ſlighted. And in this Oath, which the Attorney had taken, it was dangerous to abſolve him from it, leſt bad Example ſhould be given to diſpenſe with any Subject, that had ſworn faithful Service to the Crown; for which plain Honeſty he was wounded with a ſharp Rebuke: And the reverend Author told me this with Tears: Yet the Archb. <hi>Abbot</hi> ſaid as

Say then, that he neither did harm, nor receive any, by being ſhut out of this turbulent Parliament: Yet his Advice had been worth the asking, becauſe of the Plunges that His Majeſty was put to upon the Diſſolution; but he heard of no Call to ſuch a purpoſe: For no man looks on a Dyal in a cloudy day, when the Sun ſhines not on it. God's Mercy was in it; for he ſate ſafer at home, than he could have done at the Council-Board at this time, where much Wiſdom was tryed, to help the King's Neceſſities out of the Peoples Purſes, by a Commandatory Loan, and with the leaſt Scandal that might be; for not to run into ſome Offence was unavoidable. <hi>Pindar</hi> the Poet was call'd out of his Houſe, to ſpeak with ſome Friend in the Street, (<hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> ſays the Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teller) ſearce was his Foot over the Threſhold when the Building ſunk, and all that were within periſh'd.

Yet no Faſt was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſaving thus far, That Preachers, in their Sermons and Exhortations, ſhould move the People to Abſtinence, and Moderation in their Dyet, to the end they might be more able to relieve the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The firſt Form to be uſed in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, with an Order of publick Faſt for every <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in the week, for a time, was ſet out by Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> ſpecial Command, in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1563. when the Plague, called <hi>The Plague of</hi> New-haven, was riſe in <hi>London.</hi> In which Book is a paſſage to illuſtrate our Common-Prayer-Book, for the firſt Rubrick prefixt to the Order for the Holy Communion; That ſo many as intend to be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Holy Communion, ſhould ſignifie their Names to the Curate over night, or elſe in the morning, either before the beginning of Common Prayer, or immediately after.

When the Body of the Lords and Commons were at work, to redintegrate the empailment of the Laws, if the Biſhop had not appeared, that the King would return, to walk upon the known and trodden Cawſey of the Laws, he had forſaken himſelf, and left the neareſt way to do him Service. His care was, that no Diſhonour ſhould be caſt upon His Majeſty's Government, nor Cenſure upon the Commiſſioners of the Loan, his Miniſters, and yet to remove the publick Evils of the State: To mend them, would bring a Reformation to be bluſh'd at; not to mend them, a continued Confuſion to be griev'd at.

When the Commons fell roundly to ſiſt the exacting of the Loan, the Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will gotten by it touch'd none ſo near as the Clergy: So ill was it taken, that their Pulpits had advanc'd it, and that ſome had preach'd a great deal of Crown Divinity, as they call'd it: And they were not long to ſeek for one that ſhould be made an Example for it. But to make that, which was like to be by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent leſs offenſive, they unanimouſly voted a Giſt of five Subſidies, before the King's Servants had ſpoke a word unto it. A Taſte of Loyalty and Generoſity, that willing Supplies ſhould rather come from a ſenſe of the King's Wants, than be begged. Straitway they called Dr. <hi>Maynwaring</hi> the King's Chaplain before them, for preaching (but rather for printing) two Sermons deliver'd before the King, the one at <hi>Oatland</hi>'s, the other at <hi>Alderton,</hi> in the Progreſs in <hi>July;</hi> neither of them at St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, as Mr. <hi>W.

No notice was taken of the King's Special Command to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh theſe Tractates, but ſevering the Author by himſelf, he is deſign'd to be cenſur'd; as Keepers beat Whelps before their Lions, to make them gentler: And the Charge is brought up to the Lords, That the Sermons were ſcandalous, feditious, and againſt the good Government of this Kingdom. The Reverend Biſhops, one and all, left him undefended. Yet that was not enough to correct the Envy which the Clergy did undergo upon it; ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> ſtood up, and gave reprehenſion to ſome Points of both his Sermons, in this manner: In the former of theſe Sermons, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. Dr. <hi>Maynwaring</hi> begins his Work upon the Loom with theſe Threads; <q>That of all Relations, the firſt and original is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Creator and the Creature, the next between Husband and Wife, the third between Parents and Children, the fourth between Lord and Servants. From all which forenamed reſpects there did ariſe that moſt high, ſacred, and tranſcendent Relation between King and Subjects.</q> A ſtrange Expreſſion! which calls the laſt a tranſcendent Relation ariſing out of all the former, when the firſt of the four was between the Creator and the Creature. <hi>God is a great God, a King above all Gods.</hi> A good King indeed is a petty God, as a Tyrant is a great Devil; but far be it from us, to call the King's relation to his People tranſcendental, the Maker of all things, and his Workmanſhip being brought in before. Yet let that go not for a wilful Fault, but for an unwary Expreſſion. In the 19th Page he breaks out thus into a tranſcendent Error: <q>If any King ſhall command that which ſtands not in oppoſition to the Original Laws of God, Nature, Nations, and the Goſpel (though it be not correſpondent in every Circumſtance to Laws National and Municipal) no Subject may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

The firſt words, <hi>If any King</hi> have a great failance, as if all Kings, all alike, had the ſame Command over their Subjects, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Government, meer and abſolute from mixt and reſtrained. The body of the Doctrin is worſt of all, that it concerns us upon our Loyalty, nay, upon our Salvation, (for elſe Damnation is threatned) to yield not only Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (which is due) but Active alſo, if the King's Will and Pleaſure be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in any thing not oppoſite to the Law of God and Nature: Wherein if he had inſiſted upon thoſe ſame things, that do not appear to be yet determin'd, and have no evil Sequel, it might be allow'd him: But, that we are bound to act whatſoever a King requires, where the Law and his Will are diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and be damn'd if we draw back or queſtion it, is as corrupt as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If Subjection is due as much to the King's Pleaſure as to his Laws, there is no bottom in Obedience. Says <hi>Stamford</hi> the learned Lawyer, <hi>Miſera ſervitus eſt ubi jus eſt vagum &amp; incognitum.</hi> And is it but a Complement that a King ſwears at his Coronation, to govern by his Laws?

The Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is well laid, but his Superſtructure is crazy; for where it were Sin to ſay, that Relieſs and Aids were not due to ſome perſons, it is no Sin to ſay they ſhould not be their own Carvers. <hi>Teſtatus</hi> a great Biſhop, a great Counſellor, a great Scholar, writes upon the noted place, <hi>De jure regio,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> c. 8.

Upon this laſt he doth expatiate in three points: 1. That as Men cannot, in way of Juſtice, recompence God, nor Children their Parents, ſo nor Subjects their Kings for legal Providence. 2. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo properly call'd, intercedes not between GOD and Man, nor between the Prince, being a Father, and the People as Children: It cannot be a Rule or <hi>Medium</hi> to give God and the King his Right. 3.

And if Juſtice be not, but between Equals, how can there be any Juſtice at the <hi>Kings-bench, Exchequer, Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, Court of Wards, &amp;c?</hi> To go back now to his other two Poſitions, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling them together, obſerve two things; Firſt, All that he ſpeaks of God, and his being unrecompenſable by ordinary way of Juſtice, he borrows it out of <hi>Suarez,</hi> as his Margin confeſſeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Relig. c.</hi> 4. and of his own Head ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth to the King without <hi>Suarez,</hi> or any other Writer.

Coke</hi> made the motion (which will keep his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Memory alive) to ſue to the King by Petition, the moſt ancient and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addreſs of Parliaments, that His Majeſty would give his People Aſſurance of their Rights by Aſſent in Parliament, as he uſeth to paſs other Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> That none ſhould be compell'd to any charge of Tax or Benevolence, without agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lords and Commons; nor any Freeman be impriſon'd, but by the Law of the Land; with ſome ſuch other-like, which are enter'd into many Authors. The Duke of <hi>Buck.</hi> was forward to ſtop this Petition in the Houſe where he ſate; for which the Commons, having not yet meddled with him, reſolved to give him an ill Farewel before their parting. Neither did he recover his old Luſtre, nor carry any great ſway among the Peers, ſince his diſhonourable Expedition to <hi>Rhe;</hi> for evil Succeſſes are not eaſily forgotten, though proſperous ones vaniſh in the warmth of their Fruition. And not only that Duke, and the Lord Privy-Seal, with other great and able Officers, did repulſe this motion with all main, but the King's learned Council were admitted to plead their Exceptions againſt it. Six weeks were ſpent in theſe Delays, and <hi>Hope deſerred made their hearts ſick, Prov.</hi> 13.12. and their Heads jealous, who follow'd the cauſe, that there was no good meaning to relieve their Oppreſſions. At laſt the difficulty was overcome; the Petitioners had one Anſwer from the King, and look'd for a fuller, and had it in the end: So much ſooner had been ſo much better; as our Poet <hi>Johnſon</hi> writes to Sir <hi>E. Sackvile,</hi> of ſome mens Good-turns, <hi>They are ſo long a coming, and ſo hard.</hi> When any Deed is forc'd, the Grace is marr'd. The Subjects ask'd for nothing now which was not their own, but for Aſſurance to keep their own; which had it been done with a Smile, benignly and cheerfully, and without any caſting about to evade it, it had been done Princely. It is not impoſſible to find an honeſt Rule in <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> for this is his: <hi>Beneficia illa, quibus conciliatur plebis animus cò uſ<expan>

Haward</hi>'s Hiſt. of <hi>H.</hi> IV. <hi>p.</hi> 4. ſays he, The Multitude are more ſtrongly drawn by unprofitable Courteſies than by churliſh Benefits. Among thoſe that argued for this Petition <hi>de Droit,</hi> I ſhall remember what paſt from two eminent Prelates: Archbiſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> offer'd his own Caſe to be conſider'd, baniſh'd from his own Houſes of <hi>Croydon</hi> and <hi>Lambeth,</hi> confin'd to a mooriſh Manſion-place of <hi>Foord,</hi> to kill him, debarr'd from the management of his Juriſdiction, and no cauſe given for it to that time; harder meaſure than ever was done to him in his Pedagogy, for no Scholar was ever corrected till his Fault was told him. But he had fuller'd the Laſh in a Meſſage brought by the Secretary, and no cauſe pretended for it: And what Light of Safety could be ſeen under ſuch dark Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> likewiſe promoted the Petition, but he was a great Stickler for an Addition, that it might come to the King's Hands with a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly Clauſe, That as they deſir'd to preſerve their own Liberties, ſo they had regard to leave entire that Power wherewith His Majeſty was entruſted for the Protection of his People (which the Commons diſreliſh'd, and cauſed to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd). This cauſed the Biſhop to be ſuſpected at firſt, as if he had been ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with ſome Court-holy-water, which was nothing ſo, but a due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flowing from his own Breaſt, that ſomewhat might be inſerted, to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Grandeur of Majeſty. A Paſſage in <hi>Xenophon</hi> commends ſuch unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken Service, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Cyrip.</hi> ſays he, <hi>Hystaſpus</hi> would do all that <hi>Cyrus</hi> bade, but <hi>Chryſantus</hi> would do all which he thought was good for <hi>Cyrus</hi> before he bade him.</p>
                  <p n="77">77. In the Debate of this great matter among the Lords, this Biſhop hath left under his own Pen what he deliver'd; partly in gloſſing upon a Letter which His Majeſty under the Signet ſent to the Houſe <hi>May</hi> the 12th, partly in conteſting with the chief Speakers, that quarrel'd at the Petition. As to the former; Firſt the King ſays, That his Predeceſſors had never given Leave to the free Debates of the higheſt Points of Prerogative Royal. The Biſhop an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, The Prerogative Royal ſhould not be debated at all, otherwiſe than it is every Term in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall.</hi> Secondly, the Letter objects, What if ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery nearly concerning Matters of State and Government, be made? May not the King and his Council commit the Party in queſtion, without cauſe ſhewn?
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49492:158"/>For then Detection will dangerouſly come forth before due time. <hi>Reſp.</hi> No matter of State or Government would be deſtroyed or defeated, if the Cauſe be expreſt in general terms: And no danger can likely enſue, if in three Terms the Matter be prepared to be brought to Trial. <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. May not ſome Cauſe be ſuch as the Judges have no Capacity of Judicature, or Rules of Law to direct or guide their Judgment? <hi>Reſp.</hi> What can thoſe things be, which neither the <hi>Kings-bench</hi> nor <hi>Star-chamber</hi> can meet them? <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. Is it not enough, that we declare our Royal Will and Reſolution to be (which, God willing, we will conſtantly keep) not to go beyond a juſt Rule and Moderation in any thing, which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Laws and Cuſtoms? And that neither we nor our Council ſhall, or will, at any time hereafter, commit or command to Priſon, for any other cauſe than doth concern the State, the Publick Good, and Safety of our People? <hi>Reſp.</hi> Not the Council-Table, but the appointed Judges, muſt determine what are Laws and Cuſtoms, and what is contrary to them. And this gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is too indefinite, to make us depend upon that broad Expreſſion of Juſt Rule and Moderation. Eſpecially be it mark'd, That all the Cauſes in the Kingdom may be ſaid to concern either the State, the Publick Good, or the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King and People. This, under Favour, is abundantly irreſolute, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing obtain'd. <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. In all Cauſes hereafter of this nature, which ſhall happen, we ſhall, upon the humble Petition of the Party, or Signification of our Judges unto us, readily and really expreſs the true cauſe of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as with Conveniency and Safety it be fit to be diſoloſed: And that in all Cauſes of ordinary Juriſdiction, our Judges ſhall proceed to the delivery or bailment of the Priſoner, according to the known and ordinary Rules of this Land, and according to the Statutes of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and thoſe ſix Statutes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, which we intend not to abrogate or weaken, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention thereof. <hi>Reſp.</hi> To diſcloſe the cauſe of Impriſonment, except Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency and Safety do hinder, are ambiguous words, and may ſuffice to hold a man faſt for coming forth. And if all Cauſes be not of ordinary Juriſdiction, (as I hope they are) who ſhall judge which be the extraordinary Cauſes? We are loſt again in that Uncertainty. So likewiſe for the Intention of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the ſix Statutes, who ſhall judge of the true Intention of them? That being arbitrary, we are ſtill <hi>in nubibus</hi> for any aſſurance of legal Liberty. So the Conceſſions of His Majeſty's Letter were waved as unſatisfactory.</p>
                  <p n="78">78. And the Biſhop went on to ſhew, that the Contents of the Petition were ſuitable to the ancient Laws of the Realm, ever claimed and pleaded, expedient for the Subject, and no leſs honourable for the King, which made him a King of Men, and not of Beaſts; of brave-ſpirited Freemen, and not of broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Peaſants. The Statute in 28 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. is as clear for it, as the day at Noon-tide; That no man, of what ſtate or condition ſoever, ſhall be put out of his Lands or Tenements, nor taken, nor impriſon'd, nor diſinherited, nor put to death, without being brought to anſwer by due proceſs of Law. I know one Lord replied to this lately, That the Law was wholſom, for the good of private men, and ſometime it might be as wholſom for the Publick Weal, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power ſhould commit to Cuſtody ſome private man, the cauſe not being ſhew'd in Law, upon more beneficial occaſion than a private man's legal Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And though the Hand of Power ſhould ſeem to be hard upon that one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Benefit might redound to many. Firſt, be it conſider'd, if no Law ſhall be fixt and inviolable, but that which will prevent all Inconveniencies, we muſt take Laws from God alone, and not from men. Then be it obſerv'd, that to bring the exception of a Soveraign Power beſide the Laws, in Caſes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Laws, takes away all Laws, when the King is pleas'd to uſe and put forth this Soveraign Power, wherewith he is truſted, and makes the Government purely arbitrary, and at the Will of the King: So ſhall this Reaſon of State eat up and devour the Reaſon of Laws. Shew me, he that can, how the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a Soveraign Power, working beſide the Law inſiſted upon, ſhall not bring our Goods and our Lives to be liable and diſpoſable by this Soveraign Power, and not turn <hi>England</hi> into the caſe of <hi>Turky.</hi> And if you affirm, that a man may be taken and impriſon'd by a Soveraign Power, wherewith a King is truſted, beſide the Law expreſt in the Statute; why ſhould you not grant as well, the Law being one and the ſame, that a man may be put out of his Lands and Tenements, diſinherited, and put to death by this Soveraign Power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being brought to anſwer by due proceſs of Law? I conceive this Reaſon may be more fortified, but will never be anſwer'd and ſatisfied: Bore one hole
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49492:158"/>into this Law, and all the good thereof will run out of it. Next I ſhew, that nothing was ever attempted againſt the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> without great Envy and Grudging. Now, ſince a man's Liberty is a thing that Nature moſt deſires, and which the Law doth exceedingly favour, the 29th Chapter of that Charter ſays, <hi>Nullus liber homo impriſonetur niſi per legem terrae.</hi> What word can there be againſt theſe words? Why, it was ſaid here with Reſolution and Confidence, That <hi>Lex terrae</hi> is to be expounded of Actions of the King's Privy Council, done at the Council-Table without further Proceſs of Law. But did ever any Judge of this Land give that interpretation of <hi>Lex terrae</hi> in <hi>Magnâ Chartâ?</hi> Indeed, a great learned Lord in this Houſe did openly ſay, That all Courts of Juriſdiction in this Land eſtabliſh'd, and authoriſed by the King, may be ſaid to be <hi>Lex terrae.</hi> Which is granted by me, although it was denied by implication, by the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Houſe of Commons. But then the Queſtion ſtill remains, whether the Council-Table at <hi>Whitehall</hi> be a <hi>forum contentioſum,</hi> a Court of Juriſdiction? I ever granted, they may commit to Priſon <hi>juxta legem terrae,</hi> as they are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Peace, and of other legal Capacities. And I grant it alſo, that they may do it <hi>praeter legem terrae,</hi> as they are great Counſellors of State, and ſo to provide where the Laws are defective, <hi>ne quid detrimenti reſpub. capiat. Secondly,</hi> It was much preſt, that my L. <hi>Egerton</hi> did expound this <hi>Lex terrae</hi> to be <hi>Lex regis,</hi> which muſt mean ſomewhat, in his <hi>Poſt-nati, pag.</hi> 33. I have read the Book, and it is palpably miſtaken: That great Lord ſaith only this; That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law hath many Names <hi>ſecundùm ſubjectam materiam,</hi> according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Objects it handles. When it reſpects the Church, it is called, <hi>Lex Eccleſiae Anglicanae:</hi> When it reſpects the Crown, <hi>Lex Coronae,</hi> and ſometime <hi>Lex Regia:</hi> When it reſpects the common Subject, it is called <hi>Lex Terrae.</hi> Is not this his plain meaning? It muſt be ſo, by his inſtance <hi>p.</hi> 36. That the caſes of the Crown are, the Female to inherit, the eldeſt Son to be preferr'd, no reſpect of Half-blood, no diſability of the King's Perſon by Infancy. If his Lordſhip ſhould mean otherwiſe, his Authorities would fail him. <hi>Regiſt. fol.</hi> 61. the word <hi>Lex Regia</hi> is not nam'd, that's my Lord's Inference, but the Title is, <hi>Ad jura Regia;</hi> that is, certain Briefs concerning the King's Kights, oppoſite to <hi>Jura Papalia,</hi> or <hi>Canonica,</hi> all of them in matters eccleſiaſtical, as Advouſons, Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Quare-impedits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all pleaded in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> things never heard of in the King's dwelling Court, ſince the fixing of the Courts of Juſtice. Thus much for the Authorities. Now the reaſon offer'd out of them, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be anſwer'd, is this: By the <hi>Lex Terrae</hi> in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> a man may be not only impriſon'd, but withal outlaw'd, deſtroy'd, try'd, and condemn'd; but a man cannot be outlaw'd, deſtroy'd, try'd, and condemn'd by any Order of the Lords of the Council; therefore the Orders of the Lords of the Council are not <hi>Lex Terrae.</hi> At this, and upon other occaſions the Biſhop ſpake to this matter, (till the Petition was moſt graciouſly conſented to by the King in all the Branches of it) and was more attended to upon the Experience of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom, than at leaſt any of his Order. And as <hi>Theocritus</hi> ſays of his principal Shepherd, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>From that day</hi> Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis <hi>was accounted the Chief of his Calling, which filled the Court with the Report.</hi> But ſome men are in danger to be traduced with too much Praiſe.</p>
                  <p n="79">79. One thing ſtruck in unhappily, which made this Seſſion riſe without a good cloſe in the ſhutting up; it was a Remonſtrance preſented to the King by the Houſe of Commons, of many Complaints; the moſt offenſive being thoſe that were perſonal, againſt two Biſhops that were about the King, and againſt the L. Duke, That his exceſſive Power, and abuſe of that Power, was the cauſe of all Evils and Dangers among us. Though this came very croſs to the King's Affections, yet the worſt word that he gave to the Remonſtrance was, <hi>That no wiſe man would juſtifie it.</hi> How many Kings of <hi>England</hi> had treated both Houſes more ſharply upon leſs provocation? Yet now the chief Tribunes ſpake their Diſcontents aloud, That they had given a bountiful Levy of five Subſidies, and were called Fools for their labour. The Gift was large, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Allegiance, the Willingneſs were better than the Gift; yet might not His Majeſty touch mildly upon a Fault, without ſuch a ſcandalous Paraphraſe? The <hi>Galatians</hi> would have pulled out their own Eyes to do <hi>Paul</hi> good, yet he ſpared them not for it, but upon Errors crept into the Doctrine of their Faith, he called them <hi>fooliſh Galatians.</hi> The ſowreſt Leaven, not ſeen in the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, but hid in the Houſe, was, That ſome ſeditious Tongues did blab their meaning, to cut off the payment of Tonnage and Poundage, by the conceſſion of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49492:159"/>the Petition of Right; againſt which His Majeſty ſpake, and declar'd, That his Predeceſſors had quietly enjoy'd thoſe Payments by the Royal Prerogative, which both Houſes did proteſt to leave inviolable; That the Grant of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition did meet with Grievances, ſaid to entrench upon the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the People, to give them aſſurance of quiet from paying Taxes or Loans without Order of Parliament. To go further it was not his Meaning nor their Demand. The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> appeared very much to concur with the King's Interpretation, and was very zealous to have had an Act paſt for it before the Parliament was prorogued: Nay, he forbore not to chide his Friends in the lower Houſe, whoſe Metal he found to be churliſh, and hard to be wrought upon. <hi>Ut erat generoſae indolis nihil frigidè, nihil languidè agebat;</hi> as <hi>Clementius</hi> ſays of renowned <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> in his Life, <hi>p.</hi> 61. But the Biſhop's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was laid by, and with no good meaning: Yet ſince it was ſeen, that his Endeavours were real, to have wound up the Bottom at that time, without that ſcurvy knot in it, he had the Favour to kiſs the King's Hand, and to have Words both with His Majeſty and with the Duke in private. O hard De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny! this he had long ſought, and now the Words which paſt between the King and him in Conference, were the Seed of all his Troubles in the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> for the King conjuring him to deliver his Opinion, how he might win the Love of the Commons, and be popular among them, the Biſhop an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered readily, That the <hi>Puritans</hi> were many, and main Sticklers; if His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would pleaſe to direct his Miniſters, by his ſecret Appointment, to ſhew ſome Connivance and Indulgence to their Party, he might poſſibly mollifie them, and bend their Stubbornneſs; though he did not promiſe that they would be truſty very long to any Government. The King ſaid. He muſt needs like the Counſel, for he had thought of it before, and would uſe it. Two months after the Biſhop regulated his own Courts at <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> with ſome ſuch Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentions, and told Sir <hi>J. Lamb</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorp</hi> the reaſon, that it was not only his own, but the Royal Pleaſure. Theſe two Pick-thanks carried theſe words to Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and he to the King, being then at <hi>Biſham.</hi> The Reſolution was, That upon the Depoſitions of theſe two, (no Saints in my Almanack) a Bill ſhould be drawn up in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> againſt the Biſhop, for revealing the King's Counſels, being a ſworn Counſellor. But that he was ſentenc'd, becauſe his Tongue betrayed him into Speeches that entrencht upon Loyalty, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian <hi>H. L.</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 152. (upon whoſe Truſt <hi>W. S.</hi> writes the ſame) is utterly miſtaken, upon the word of Holy Faith; and let all Ear-witneſſes of the Cauſe, and Eye-witneſſes of the Records, judge between us. Nor do I ſay, that the Bill of diſcloſing the King's Counſels held Water, for it was laid aſide: There the Troubles began, and did run through Motions, Meanders, and Alterations, till ending at laſt in tampering with Witneſſes, as will be ſhewn in due place.</p>
                  <p n="80">80. To make this ſeem a Jubilee to our Biſhop, wherein all Bonds of Malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhould be cancell'd, he had a very courteous Interview with the L. Duke, nothing of Unkindneſs repeated between them, his Grace had the Biſhop's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with a little asking, that he would be his Grace's faithful Servant in the next Seſſion of Parliament, and was allow'd to hold up a ſeeming Enmity, and his own Popular Eſtimation, that he might the ſooner do the Work. Bleſſed be God, that they parted then in perfect Charity, for they never met again; the horrid Aſſaſſine <hi>J. Felton,</hi> fruſtrated whatever might have followed; a mean, deſpicable, unſuſpected Enemy: <hi>Sed nihil tam firmum eſt, cui non ſit periculum ab invalido,</hi> ſays <hi>Curtius, lib.</hi> 7. What Strength is there in a Cedar, ſince every weak Arm can cut it down? And though I am perſwaded none but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and this melancholy Miſcreant were in the Plot, yet <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> many were guilty of this Blood, that rejoiced it was ſpilt. <hi>Tully</hi> confeſt of himſelf, that he was as much a Murderer of <hi>Caeſar</hi> as <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> 2 <hi>Philip.

As the Commons had no power to take his life away, ſo they never intended it, but to remove him from the King, if it were poſſible.

Was it ſo lately enacted in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that no Freeman ſhould be impriſon'd without due courſe of Law, and did Hell break looſe at the other end, to make it meritorious, or popular, to kill without Law? For ſuch another Outrage had paſs'd but two months before, upon the Body of one <hi>Lamb,</hi> in the day-light, and in the Skirts of the City beaten cruelly to Death by a ſcum of Vagabonds, being no Conjurer for certain, (though the Fry fell upon him for that ſuſpicion) but a notorious Impoſtor, a Fortune-teller, and an employ'd Bawd, (two Qualities that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make up one pair of Sciſſors to cut Purſes) as was evident by his Books, Papers, Schemes, Pictures, Figures, Glaſſes, the Utenſils of his Trade, found in his Lodgings near the Horſe-ferry in <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> But, that he was a Creature of the Duke's, and commended to him by Biſhop <hi>Williams,</hi> the Hiſtorian is ſtrangely out again. It is poſſible an Ear-dropper might hear ſuch things talk'd at Cock-pits and Dancing-ſchools, miſerable Intelligence to thruſt into an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. This <hi>Lamb</hi> living in the Verge of the Deanry, was once admitted to ſpeak with this Biſhop, and as ſoon as he began to impeach ſome of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Acquaintance for Falſhood, he was bidden be gone, for a meddling Knave, and a Sower of Diſſentions, and had Warning to come near him no more. And for the Duke, his domeſtick Creatures have avowed to me, that <hi>Lamb</hi> was ſo little their Lord's Creature, that they were ready to take an Oath of Credulity, that the Duke never ſaw him. I would all the Tales that got his Grace Ill will had been as falſe as this: That which did undo him, was chiefly that which made him, the immoderate Favour of two Kings, and not mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately uſed; as many a Ship is loſt, that's overſet with too much Sail. After Thirteen years triumphing in Grace and Gallantry, one Stab diſpatch'd him. So <hi>Symmachus</hi> ſpeaks of the ſad Cataſtrophe of ſuch a mighty man, <hi>Fortunae diu lenocinantis perfidus finis, quem ultimâ ſui parte ut ſcorpius percuſſit, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ep.</hi> 13. Great Felicities not ſeldom go out ſuddenly in a Flaſh, like a Silk-worm, that dyes in three months after it is quicken'd. God would have us look after better things, when we behold the ſudden and prodigious Eclipſes of Human Glory, and brought to paſs, like <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s, by vile and wicked Inſtruments. A foreign Writer gives very hard words to our whole Nation upon it, that we are ſavage and frentick in our Fury: And will he ſay as ill of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for <hi>Joab</hi>'s ſake, that murder'd <hi>Abner?</hi> It might be replied to him, That the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of his Nation is beſmeared with the Blood of two Kings of <hi>France,</hi> deadly wounded with a Knife. But that we have worſe to anſwer for, I will depart with this mournful matter, adding only, that the Duke being taken away, our Biſhop never deſiſted to do Obſervance, and ſuch Help as he could, to his deſolate Kindred and Family; which the Counteſs of <hi>Denby</hi> his Siſter would often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to me, and ſpeak of it to his great honour. At this time, preſently upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Tydings, he diſpatch'd a moſt melting Letter to the Counteſs, his Grace's Mother, whoſe Anſwer to his begins thus:

The <hi>Duke</hi> being now at reſt in his Grave, it was conceived this Good at leaſt would come of it, that the next Seſſion of Parliament would be very quiet, which began on the 20th of <hi>January:</hi> Yet they that thought the Ship was lightned of <hi>Jonas,</hi> ſaw the Storm encreaſed: Let them that will know the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a wide Breach, read it in the Hiſtories and Life of King <hi>Charles,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in His Majeſty's Declaration to all his loving Subjects, printed 1628.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49492:160"/>wherein the intelligent ſhall find, that the Commons were rather ſtubborn than ſtiff, rather violent than eager againſt the King's Affairs; and that the King was ſo provok'd with the heat of one morning, that he would not allow a day, nor an hour, to let them cool again, but diſmiſt them with Menaces, and thruſt them away from him with ſuch diſpleaſure, that in twelve years he ſent out no Writs to call another Parliament. It is too late to wiſh it had been better then, it is not too late to give Warning that it may be better hereafter. Who did beſt or worſt many will take the liberty to determine, as their addictions carry them to loyal Duty or popular Liberty. I judge neither ſo high above me in their potential Orbs, but relate what the Prudent did obſerve upon their Paſſages: This was the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Opinion, who wept the ruine of the State, and was able to ſee through the preſent to the future, that it was ill in the People to offend ſo good a King, and unhappy for the King to cloſe again no ſooner with a bad People. The open face of both theſe ſhall be ſeen. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were no ſooner come together, but like <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Rhetorick in the Poet, <hi>Proh Jupiter inquit,</hi> they were as hot as an Oven in their <hi>exordium,</hi> and ſpake loudly, That the Petition of Right was not maintain'd, becauſe Tonnage and Poundage were taken, and Merchants Goods diſtrein'd for non-payment, a Revenue not due to the Crown till paſs'd by Bill. The King's Council ſhew'd Preſidents, that it had been taken in a proviſional way before the Parliament had granted it; but that His Majeſty did deſire to receive it by the Grant of his People, and pray'd a Bill might confirm it, to remove this Block out of the way, in which all Controverſies would be ſopited. Hereupon it was promis'd it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and the framing of a Bill be referr'd to a Committee; yet they drew back their Hand, till they had gather'd a Particular of things diſtaſted in the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Government: An Affectation which <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in the Tribunes, <hi>Liv. dec.</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Qui ſemper aegri aliquid in Rep. eſſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt, ut ſit ad cujus curationem à vobis adhibeantur:</hi> Which the King hath put into Engliſh, <hi>Declar. p.</hi> 25. <hi>Like Empericks, that ſtrive to make new Work, and to have ſome Diſeaſes on foot, to keep themſelves in requeſt.</hi> Their Inſpections about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were not only troubleſome, to make the Bill ſtick in the Committee, the only means to keep all quiet, but ſo inauſpicious, that I fear God was not near. <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> was complained of, that it was openly maintain'd, not ſuiting with the Articles of the Churches of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> A ſtrange Spell, which rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up the Spirit that it would conjure down. As they that mark the encreaſe of <hi>Nile</hi> can tell at what day it will begin to overflow, ſo they that watcht the encreaſe of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> ſay conſidently, that from this year the Tyde of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to come in. Then they complain'd, that the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Winton,</hi> prevail'd to advance thoſe to great Preferments that ſpread thoſe Errors, while the orthodox part was depreſt, and under inglorious diſdain. Never was this verified by a clear and notorious diſtinction, till this Challenge was made, That all Preferments were caſt on that ſide. Then it began to be palpable, that there was no other way to fly over other mens Heads in the Church, but with thoſe Wings: And here the forlorn part might ſay to the Parliament as <hi>Balak</hi> ſaid to <hi>Balaam, What haſt then done unto me? I took thee to curſe mine Enemies, and behold, thou haſt bleſt them all together, Numb.</hi> 23.11. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They did regret at the obtruding of ſome Ceremonies, which waxed in more requeſt and authority upon that oppoſition; as ſome Flowers open the more, when the Wind blows ſtrongeſt upon them. I believe ſuch Remorſe as was in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren would make ſome of them ſay, <hi>We ſaw the arguiſh of the King, when he beſought us, and would not hear, therefore this Diſtreſs is come upon us, that all our Counſels are improſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> The proſecution of Civil Grievances miſcarried as much, and as wiſe men gueſs'd, becauſe Sir <hi>John Ellict</hi> ſtood up to manage them.

Some body muſt bear that Burden as the Duke had done; yet this Lord was not like to be the man, who had been in his great Place but about ſix months, unleſs he could conjure, and work Miracles in a trice. The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who had Spies abroad in many private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, inform'd the L. <hi>Weſton</hi> before, who was his Adverſary, what Coals he was blowing at the Forge, and proffer'd himſelf to bring Sir <hi>J.

Wentworth</hi> ſpleen'd the Biſhop, for offering to bring his Rival into favour; but L. <hi>Weſton</hi> took it as a Courteſie as long as he lived, and bade the Biſhop look for more Favour from the King than it was his luck to find; for the Treaſurer was noted to be a Servant to his Maſter of great uſe and diligence, but a Friend to his Friends of ſmall aſſiſtance. Now, when great Affairs did run upon the Wheels of theſe private Grudges, what was like to become of the Publick Weal? To be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd in the hurry.</p>

That which was free Gift at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtantly given, Cuſtom makes it a Debt. The King's Actions were ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warranted with the wiſdom of former Ages: for the Subſidy of Tonnage and Poundage was not granted to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth by Parliament, till the end of the third year of his Reign, yet anſwer'd to him from the firſt year. And, to ſay more, all Kings and Queens enjoy'd it from the day of the precedent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Death, before ever a Parliament ſat: and the legitimate receiving it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver queſtion'd. And yet now the Commons pleaded, <hi>That until the King would put himſelf out of all the Right of it, the Subject ſtood not in ſit caſe to grant it;</hi> Decl. p. 28. That is, ſhut himſelf out of Doors, and ſtay till, God knows when, they let him in again. And wherefore was the Petition objected? which was granted to ſecure all men in their Property for the Subject's Right, not for the King's wrong. They that were reaſonable and thankful men will allow him to interpret his own meaning, which was not to take from his Liege people what he ſhould not, but not to give from himſelf what he would not.

His Majeſty was willing to take this Payment as the Gift of the Parliament, would thankfully embrace it with that Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But it were folly to let them poliſh his Revenue, and file away the beſt part of it. They knew he could not want this Stock, as well to guard the Kingdom, as to ſupport his own Dignity.

To render good for evil, and to bring them all within one Circle of Love and Clemency, a gracious and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Pardon was appointed by the King to be drawn up, which paſt the Houſe of Lords; but the Gentlemen beneath did not ſo much as read it.

                  <p n="83">83. Look now in the procedure upon the way that the King choſe to go in, with an Eye of Reverence, but with an Eye of Reaſon. The Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> moved the Lord <hi>Weſton</hi> to carry his mind to the King, much after this ſort: <hi>That the Parliament might meet again for all this, and that there might be a Conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Lords, to debate upon Differences. He hoped that their own Houſe would give a check, if not a cenſure to ſome that had exceeded in ſuch a rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parliamentary uprore: that they would in no long ſpace of time be aſhamed of their own work, and make amends with ſubmiſſion.

Kings have another Sentiment of Wrongs then common People. Yet one Rulo is as good for them, as for their Vaſſals, to let Counſels mellow, and to grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a taſte by leiſure: waiting for time and opportunity are ſuch advantages, as tire out the ſpirits of others, till we have melted their metal.

Whether he had little or ſufficient inſight into Government, is diſputable, but he knew how to govern the King: Like <hi>Anaximander</hi> the Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer to <hi>Alexander the Great, Cui credulitatem ſuam rex addixerat.

Many did ſuſpect that there was ſmall hope to unite theſe, becauſe the one was hard Wax, the other ſoft: Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> would not connive at the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> nor ſeek them with fair Entreaties, but went on to ſuppreſs the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders, or to make them fly the Kingdom. Biſhop <hi>Williams</hi> perceived that this made the Faction grow more violent, to triumph againſt Juſtice, as if it were Perſecution, that the cutting of ſome great Boughs made the Under woods grow the faſter. His way to mitigate them, was to turn them about with the fallacy of Meekneſs: If they came to him, they had courteous Hoſpitality; if they ask'd his Counſel in Suits of Law, he gave them all aſſiſtance; if ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies would go down with them, he waited till their queaſie Stomachs would digeſt the reſt; he thought it no diſhoneſt thing, if he might win his weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to ſhift a Point of the Compaſs, when the Winds blew overthwart, and to fetch them in, not always by a ſtreight courſe, but ſometimes by Obliquity. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſuniſon was this: Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> was not only a great Patron of them that maintain <hi>Arminius,</hi> or, as they would have it, <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s Doctrin, but a great diſcountenancer of the oppoſite part. And ſince he ſhook the Box, they were but Duices and Trays in all Church-Preferments. The Indraught of this Partiality wax'd into a new Faction, never known before he ſate at the Stern: The King's
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49492:162"/>Declaration, <hi>pag.</hi> 21. ſpeaks not a little to it, that Biſhop <hi>Montague</hi>'s Book did open the way to thoſe Schiſms and Diviſions, which ſince have enſued in the Church.

And therefore he ſays in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at the Faſt, <hi>p.</hi> 56. <hi>We have a knowing, learned, and right venerable Clergy, the buſie Meddling of ſome few in matters of no moment excepted; for though it is not about ſo ſmall a thing as a ſtrife of Words, yet it is ſo great a thing, as no Words could ever determine.</hi> Even <hi>Knot</hi> the Jeſuite writes ſo to Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> upon thoſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions eagerly contended in, between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and his Order, Who hath aſſured you, that the Point wherein theſe learned men differ is Revealed Truth, and capable of a deciſion? Or, is it not rather by plain Scripture indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable? Or by any Rule of Faith? There came out an Order from the King, (and every one knew who ſuggeſted it) to ſuppreſs all Preaching, or Reading in the Univerſities, upon the Queſtions decided at <hi>Dort,</hi> which was ſtraightway parallel'd with an Hiſtory in <hi>Baronius, A.</hi> 648. <hi>N.</hi> 12. <hi>That</hi> Paul, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>ſeeing his Opinion of a</hi> Monothelite <hi>decried every where, he perſwaded the Emperor to ſet out an Edict, to ſilence the diſputing on either ſide.</hi> This Direction of His Majeſty's our Biſhop obeyed, but with a foreſight, that ſuch a Reſtraint would make Zealots of each Opinion be more importunate to advance their Doctrin, and that every Spark would kindle another, and ſpread apace to a general Combuſtion. We are told by <hi>Camerarius, Mel.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 270. that <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt had <hi>Melancthon</hi> moſt in Jealouſie, for declining his Interim, though he ſaid nothing. So my L. of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was moſt ſuſpected for a Gain-ſayer of the King's Order, though none did keep it with ſtricter Duty: Neither did it make him innocent to ſit quiet, ſince he did not appear to favour it: He that did not tune his Mind, as well as his outward Carriage, to the preſent Harmony, was cenſur'd to be out of Tune, and not fit for the Quire. So it was contriv'd, that this Prelate, no meddler that way, muſt be knock'd down, as the Supporter of the Adherents to the <hi>Dort</hi> Synod, and others for fear would veil their Top-fails. Like to <hi>Agelaeus</hi>'s Speech in <hi>Homer,</hi> to his Fellows the Suitors of <hi>Penelope, Let us throw all our Darts together at</hi> Ulyſſes, <hi>and kill him:</hi>

If you will not hear the ſound of a Bell, let it alone, and do not pull the Rope.</hi> Theſe are the true Diſcloſures wherefore Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> took the other Biſhop not to be a man after his own Heart, and thruſt him out of Favour, out of Power, out of Houſe and Home, and out of all he had.

As <hi>Livy</hi> ſays of <hi>Spain, Hiſpania pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mò tentata eſt à Romanis, ſed poſtremò ſubacta; It was the firſt Kingdom the</hi> Romans <hi>invaded, and the laſt they conquered:</hi> So this was the firſt of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Preferment ſet upon, and the laſt which he delivered up. Since he would not be forced out of it, it was carried with a Stratagem to keep him from it; for in four years he was not admitted to preach a Sermon in <hi>Lent</hi> before the King, the courſe for his Place being uſually on <hi>Good-Friday;</hi> and three years together, when he came to the Chapters, or to the Election, to ſee it fairly carried for the choice of the beſt Scholars, he could not reſt above a day in the College, but Secretary <hi>Coke,</hi> either <hi>viva voce,</hi> or by his Letters, which are yet ſaved, commanded him from the King, to return to his Biſhoprick: As terrible a Prophet as <hi>Eliſha</hi> was to the Noble-man of <hi>Samaria,</hi> upon the Plenty of Corn predicted, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eyes, but thou ſhalt not eat of it,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 7.2. This might fret the Biſhop, but not affright him. And he ask'd the Secretary ſo ſtoutly, <hi>what Law he brought with him to command him from his Freehold;</hi> that the good old man was ſenſible that he had done an Injury. In fine, the chief Agitant ſaw, that this Tryal, upon ſo firm a Courage, was uneffectual and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: Neither was it a little Breath that could ſhake him from his Stalk, like a Douny Blow-ball.</p>

And ſome words were dropt in the Archbiſhop's Letter, to ſignifie, that it was preſumed, that being in the Place of Lord Keeper, he had paſs'd a Diſpenſation under the Great Seal for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to enjoy the <hi>Commenda</hi> of the Deanry, for his better accommodation in that Office.

He breaks no Law who pleads a Privilege; nor doth that Subject tranſgreſs in Order, who produceth a juſt and lawful Diſpenſation to exempt him from the ſame, as your Grace by daily experience well knoweth. For other matters, that proceed from wrong and ſiniſter Informations, I do intend to procure one or other of my good Lords of the Council, to let His Majeſty underſtand how theſe things are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerved, as ſoon as I can: As firſt, to repreſent unto His Majeſty, that no L. Keeper can iſſue forth a Diſpenſation of this nature, nor any other perſon whoſoever, but either His Majeſty, immediately by his Regal Right, and Eminency of Power, or your Grace by the Act of Parliament: So as my being Lord Keeper did contribute no more to this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, than it did to all others; that is to ſay, Wax and Impreſſion. Your Grace may call to mind, we were four Governours of ſeveral Colleges made Biſhops at one time, and two of theſe had their Colleges put into their <hi>Commenda's,</hi> as well as myſelf. And in your Graces Memory alſo, in the moſt exact times of Eccleſiaſtical Government, when thoſe Promotions were manag'd with the Advice of that great and wiſe Prelate the Lord <hi>Bancroft,</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol</hi> kept the Deanry of <hi>York</hi> together, and a Biſhop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> this of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> during his Incumbency, with many others the like. Neither did the then L. Keeper procure the Faculty to hold this Deanry; for the late King, my dear Maſter, of Bleſſed Memory, was not about <hi>London,</hi> but at <hi>Rutford</hi> in <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhire,</hi> when he granted me this gracious Favour. Nor, to deal ingenuouſly with your Grace, was it gained by mine own Power, or Intereſt with His Majeſty, but by the Mediation of His Majeſty now reigning, and by the Duke of <hi>Buck.</hi> together with ſome inducement of the deceaſed King, not unknown to ſome yet living; and howbeit my Faculty is without diſtinction of Time, yet am I no chaſer of mine own Time, but do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49492:164"/>my ſelf to thoſe particular ſeaſons, which the local Statutes of the Colledge, and my expreſs Oath to perform the ſaid Statutes, do enjoyn me: That is to ſay, the two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the great Feſtivals. All which ſpace of time doth not, being taken in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct ſpaces, make a Biſhop a Non-reſident by any Law I know of, nor conſequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his Majeſties Inſtructions, though a man had no Diſpenſation; which Inſtructions require only that Biſhops ſhould reſide: but we preſume that it is no part of his Majeſties gracious intention, that they ſhould be confined, or as it were impriſoned in their Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks. I hope to procure a fair repreſentation of theſe particulars to his Majeſty, and thereby to obtain his gracious approbation, of as much reſidence as I intend to make in the Deanry. Where (as your Grace knoweth as well as I) in regard of Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal, of preventing Ruins and Dilapidations, of Hoſpitality, of Suits in Law, of the Church, the School, the Colledge, and the like, I have no leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of abiding ſometimes then upon my Biſhoprick, and ſomewhat more, becauſe of my Oath.</p>

A Prelate or twain were conſulted about this Bill of extorted Fees, and they bid it good ſpeed; which was no leſs than to pull an old Houſe upon their own heads; for the Sums, according to the Tables of their own Regiſtries, were the ſame or greater.

Although I am content, as Men of My Calling ought to be, to paſs with the reſt of the World through good report and bad, yet I am not able to endure that impreſſion which the ſaid Relation may peradventure have wrought in your Majeſties breaſt againſt me; a Biſhop that hath ſerv'd your Father in ſo near a place while be lived, and cloſed his Eyes when he died, and remains ſtill in the number of your poor Chaplains, free from the leaſt ſuſpicion of ſuch ſordid Avarice, as might cauſe him to ſpot his Roche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>, with the exaction of ſo mean a Sum as 20 l. a year, which is the utmoſt of that pretended Extorſion. The Charges preſt upon me with many Words, but no Matter at all, are two: The firſt concerning an Order for Increaſing the Clerk of the Hamper's Fees, 19 <hi>Jac.</hi> The ſecond about Fees for Inſtitutions, and Reſignations taken by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> My Anſwer for the Clerk of the Hampers Fees conſiſts of theſe Heads: 1. That the King may juſtly and legally increaſe the Fees of all Offices in his own immediate donation, not limited by Act of Parliament, and hath ever been done ſo; which was granted by all the Lords. 2. His late Majeſty, before my coming to the Seal, had referr'd the ſuggeſtions of the Clerk of the Hamper for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Fees unto thoſe four great Lords, who had the Seal in their cuſtody, and that their Lordſhips by their report did allow the ſame, and returned a Certificate unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of all the Species wherein the Fees were to be increaſed; which was confeſſed by two of their Lordſhips then preſent. 3. This Certificate was recommended to me both by word of mouth from his Majeſty, and by direction upon a Petition, ſubſcribed, to my
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49492:166"/>Remembrance, by the Secretary of State, which Petition the Commiſſioners might call for from the Clerk of the Hamper, who had it for the inſtructing of his Council, and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Evidence. 4. Upon my doubting of the form, how this might be done by Law and Preſident, the King's Council learned, to wit, the Attorny and Sergeant, did, not in the Clerk of the Hanpers only, but in the King's behalf, ſatisfie the Court fully in both thoſe particulars, which is expreſs in the Order. 5. That thereupon the Court being aſſiſted with one or two Judges, without examining the Suggeſtions, (which the Court ſuppoſed to be ſufficiently done by the former Referrees) the Order was made; which Order for the eaſe of the Subjects, doth retrench and cut ſhort very much of the Fees allowed by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Certificate. 6. For Orders made in the High Court of Chancery, the Judge for that time being, doth not conceive that he is reſponſable to any Power under Heaven, beſide the King himſelf. And this was the effect of my Anſwer concerning that Order for encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Fees of the Clerk of the Hanper. My Anſwer concerning the Fees in the Dioceſs of <hi>Lincoln</hi>is wholly omitted in the Report, as though I had been only called before the Commiſſioners, but for form; and it was to this effect, 1.That the Certificate from the Country layeth nothing to my charge. 2. That I never gave Direction for receiving of any Fees, but took thoſe only which were deliver'd to me by the Regiſter. 3. That I conceived the Fees of <hi>Lincoln</hi> Dioceſs to be much lower than of any other in <hi>England,</hi> which the L. <hi>Wentworth</hi> ſeemed to confeſs to be ſo. 4. That if the Regiſter did receive 23 s. 4 d. of every Clerk inſtituted for the Biſhop's Fee, it was no more than the Table allow'd. 5. That the Fees queſtion'd were received by my four immediate Predeceſſors, Biſhops <hi>Mountain, Neale, Barlow, Chaderton,</hi> Which four Biſhops take up a ſpace of time, which extends beyond the Table of Fees. And the L. <hi>Wentworth</hi> ſaid, he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as much, and promiſed to report it. 6. My L. of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> is able to aſſure as much, that theſe are the ancient Fees of the Dioceſs; and that I believe my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That for mine own part, and mine own time, I was ready to lay all my Fees (being, God wot, a moſt contemptible Sum) at your Majeſties Feet, to be diſpoſed of as your Majeſty pleaſed. Nor had I ever in my Life toucht one Penny of the ſame, but given it away from time to time to mend my Servants Entertainment. 8. That the 135<hi>th</hi> Canon mentioned by the Commiſſioners, refers the examination of all Fees in queſtion, not ſettled by Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the Archbiſhop only, and the Cognizance eccleſiaſtical, who is the only proper Judge of theſe Queſtions: Therefore I humbly beſeech your Majeſty, that I may not be drawn to conteſt with my Soveraign, in a Suit of Law of ſo mean and miſerable a Charge as this is, but rather, if thoſe two reverend Prelates ſhall not be able to ſatisfie your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, you will be pleaſed to hear me your ſelf, or tranſmit the Cauſe to the Lords of the Council, or where it is only proper to be heard, to the Archbiſhop of the Province, and that Mr. Attorny-General may ſtay the Proſecution elſewhere; which I ſhall embrace with all humble Duty and Thankfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Which reference to the Archbiſhop was granted, who did authorize the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of thoſe Fees for the preſent <hi>De benè eſſe</hi> only. And after Sir H. <hi>Martin</hi> and others had examin'd the Tables, Regiſtries, and Witneſſes of Credit and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, for the Antiquity of the ſame, upon their Report the ſeveral Fees were aſcertain'd by his Grace's Subſcription, for the time to come.

                  <p n="93">93. Remember that in this petitionary Letter the Biſhop calls himſelf the King's Chaplain, but not his Counſellor; for about a year by-gone the King had commanded that his Name ſhould be expunged, and not remain in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of thoſe honourable perſons: <hi>And who is ſo faithful among all thy ſervants as</hi> David? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.24. Yet ſo it was decreed, he muſt not challenge the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, nor keep the Ceremony of the Name; and more he had not in four years before. No worſe an Author than Sir <hi>E.

And, who ſhall decide it? It will ſcarce come within the Law; and when a King will hold the Concluſion, he will be too hard for any man in Logick. Let the Maſters of the Republick contend about it, whoſe Counſellors have changed as faſt as the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the year. Surely His Majeſty ſhewed himſelf much offended in this action, yet <hi>it is better for a King not to give, than to take away;</hi> which <hi>Xenophon</hi> put into <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Mouth, <hi>lib.</hi> 7.

The Earl anſwer'd him home and ingenuouſly, <hi>That he muſt expect worſe than this, becauſe he was ſuch a Champion for the Petition of Right;</hi> and, <hi>that there was no room at the Table for thoſe that would abide it.</hi> Which was like the Fortune o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The more ſharp Diſeaſes ſuffer not the leſſer to be perceived; yet this Omiſſion, light as it might ſeem, did twinge him, even to outward demonſtrance of Dejectedneſs, that in ſo good a day, wherein the Clemency of the King ſhould have run at waſte to all men, that then he ſhould be ſeparated from his Countenance and this Solemnity. <hi>But,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in one reſpect it was well, for I would not have ſaid</hi> Amen to <hi>Biſhop</hi> Laud<hi>'s Prayer (which he conceived for the Royal Infant, and was commended to all Pariſh-Churches) in that paſſage,</hi> Double his Father's Graces, O Lord, upon him, if it be poſſible. <hi>No Supplication could be better, than to crave encreaſe of Grace for that Noble Branch; for when a Prince is very good, God is a Gueſt in a human Body: But to put in a Suppoſal, whether the Holy Ghoſt could double thoſe Gifts to the Child, which he had given to his Father, and to confine the Goodneſs and Almightineſs of the Lord, it was three-piled Flattery, and loathſome Divinity. Let</hi> Cartwright <hi>and all his Part ſhew ſuch an Exception againſt any line in our Common-Prayer, and I will confeſs they have ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for their Non-ſubſcription.</hi> To carry on mine own Work: When it was known what ſmall eſteem His Majeſty had of this Biſhop, it raiſed him up the more Adverſaries, who catcht at every thing that was next, and turn'd it to a Weapon to ſtrike him; of which Sir <hi>Robert Osborn</hi> High-Sheriff of <hi>Huntington<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> was aware.

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1632. in the declining of <hi>November,</hi> Dr. <hi>Theodore Price,</hi> Sub-dean of <hi>Weſtminſter College,</hi> was cut to be cured of the Torment of the Stone; his Wound growing dry, his Preſent-death was preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Mr. <hi>James Molins,</hi> his Chyrurgion, gave intelligence, that his Patient did diſcover to ſome Viſitants of the Romiſh Faction, when he thought Mr. <hi>Molins</hi> did not hear him, his Affection and Devotion to their Church: That a Table was prepared, covered, Plate ſet on, with a Wax Light, and a piece of Gold laid by it, (this is his punctual Relation) all being diſmiſt, and none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Room but Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> a very skilful Phyſician and a Papiſt, who is yet living) and a little old man, ſeen there but once before, who continued together about an hour.</q> The Biſhop being at <hi>Bugden,</hi> informed of all this, came in the depth of Winter in all haſte to Town, and when he had lighted, before he would go to his own Lodgings, he went to the Sub-dean, whom he found in ſad plight, not like to continue; ſo without more ado he offer'd to pray with him at the Bed's-ſide, and was ſpoken to by the Doctor to forbear. Says the Biſhop, <hi>Couſin, you have need of holy Aſſiſtance, will you entertain any of the Prebendaries, or ſome other Church-man, to do this Godly Office for you belonging to the Sick?</hi> He ſtifly refuſed them all. The Biſhop propounded, that his weak ſtate might be remembred to God at the Evening Prayers in the Abby. <hi>No,</hi> ſays the other, <hi>I do not deſire them.

Only, my Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that you will be no more a Trouble to me; and that you will take my poor Servant, being unprovided, into your Care and Family.</hi> Which was not forgot, for the Biſh. received his Servant, whom afterward he preferr'd in Means and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the City of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> for he was more careful of the Children, Alliances, and Relations of his Friends, when they were dead, than of themſelves when they were living.

                           <p>UPon the Meſſage which I received from Mr. <hi>Sherman,</hi> of your Graces intention to viſit my Dioceſs this year, being the year of mine own Triennial Viſitation; and the certain News I heard of Sir <hi>J. Lamb's</hi> collecting of Preſidents, to induce your Officers to ſtir up your Grace thereunto, I have, both by my ſelf and others, made ſome enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Records, and ſeveral Regiſtries of the Dioceſs, and do find clearly, that in <hi>Groſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head's</hi> time, <hi>anno</hi> 1235. this Dioceſs had never been metropolitically viſited, and that ever ſince that time, until now, no Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> did viſit this Dioceſs (otherwiſe than in vacancy of the See) but by the vertue and power of ſome particular Bull procured from the Pope, or Letter of Aſſiſtance from the King's Majeſty, ſince the Supremacy was reaſſumed in this Realm. And I find the ſeveral Biſhops in theſe ſeveral Ages to have aſſented to theſe Viſitations, as they were Papal and Regal only, not forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring notwithſtanding to exerciſe all manner of Act or Acts belonging to their Juriſdiction Epiſcopal, not only in the times, but in and on the very days of theſe Archiepiſcopal Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and refuſing to pay any Procurations or other Fees, by vertue of a ſpecial exemption
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49492:168"/>granted unto this See, and ſome others, by Pope <hi>Innocent </hi> the Fourth, by the procurement of Biſhop <hi>Groſthead,</hi> depoſited in this Regiſtry, and never waved by the Biſhops of this See, however, ſome other of your Graces Suffragans have omitted peradventure (as having not the cuſtody thereof) to implead the ſame: Yet do I differ (may it pleaſe your Grace) in this particular from all my Predeceſſors in this See, that I do believe your Grace may viſit, even by your own metropolitical Power, all this Dioceſs, (unleſs this great Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of an hundred years may debarr the ſame) but truly I do, under Favour, conceive, that your Grace ought not to inhibit my ordinary Juriſdiction, nor do any acts to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the ſame. Nor can I find any word ſounding that way, in any one of all the Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions kept, as before is rehearſed, by your Grace's Predeceſſors, excepting only in Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Cranmer's, the laſt Archbiſhop, who above one hundred years ſince viſited this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and yet <hi>Longland,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> did not only execute all parts of his Juriſdiction, <hi>pendente viſitatione metropoliticâ,</hi> but the Dean of the Arches, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Cranmers,</hi> and the King's chief Commiſſioner for that Service, did freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily of himſelf ſet all the Biſhop's Officers at full liberty, to exerciſe all their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, after the firſt day of his Viſitation, reſerving his Detections only to his own cognizance. Now, ſince this Viſitation of Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> (which was more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal than Metropolitical, as appears by the Inſtructions given to the Commiſſioners at that time) no Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath ever offer'd to viſit this Dioceſs, as well for the Reaſons premiſed, as becauſe all the means of Livelihood belonging to this See, being taken away by the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> 2 Ed. 61. and a new, airy, and phantaſtical Corps being framed for the miſerable Biſhoprick, conſiſting in great part of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, if your Grace ſhould inhibit the exerciſe thereof, and divert the Profits aſſigned therefrom for the Biſhop's Maintenance, he ſhould not be able to eat or drink, much leſs to pay unto his Majeſty Firſt-fruits, Tenths, and Subſidies, charged upon this Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick, with relation to this laſt Endowment: In the which laſt Difference this Biſhoprick is, for ought I know, miſerably diſtinguiſh'd from all others. Thus I conceive the caſe to ſtand, my gracious Lord; and I hope, (unleſs your Grace will be pleaſed to permit me to go on with my Viſitation for this year, and take further time to conſider thereof) by our <hi>Lady-Eve,</hi> to procure all thoſe ſeveral pieces, which confirm theſe Premiſſes, to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed out of our Records and Regiſtries, and ſent by my Officers to attend your Grace's further Good-will and Pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

If ever any had a Wolf by the Ear, the Biſhop was in that quandary upon this provocation. Gladly he would have made his Peace with the King, to which he came near twice or thrice, but at laſt utterly loſt the ſight of it: It behoved him, for his Safety, not to make
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49492:169"/>them his Enemies, who were like to be his Judges; chiefly not to treſpaſs againſt the Likings of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> who could draw the King with one Hand far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than all the Lords in the Court with their whole Arm. From <hi>anno</hi> 1627, when the Letter was written in the Caſe of the Vicar of <hi>Grantham,</hi> to <hi>anno</hi> 1636, there had been much done in Preaching and Practice, to introduce ſome come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſes in the Worſhip of God, as they were ſtiled, which had not been before.

If he return'd them their own again, then pull him to the Stake, and worry him in the <hi>Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> where he was ſtruggling for Life at this time; in which fatal juncture the King muſt be told, that he was an Enemy to the Piety of the Times, and the Good Work in hand: So that this Spaniel was to put up the Fowl, that the Eagle might fall upon the Quarry.

98. I have cleared the riſe of the Controverſie which follows, That a Letter of the Biſhop's was ſent to ſome few perſons, nine years before, to ſtop a Debate in a private Pariſh, and to make Peace in the place. This was publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> with a Confutation, and cenſur'd for Popular Affectation, Diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Church, Sedition, and for no better than No Learning: And the Plot was, as Concurrencies will not let it be denied, to pop out this Pamphlet, when the Biſhop's Cauſe in <hi>Star-chamber</hi> was now ripe for hearing: And this was the Pack-needle to draw the Whip-cord of the Cenſure after it. But what was this about? Take the Subſtance, or rather the Shadow, that was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, out of the Letter, in an Abſtract: The Vicar of <hi>Grantham, P. T.</hi> of his own Head, and never conſulting the Ordinary, had removed the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table to that upper part of the Chancel, which he called the Altar-place, where he would officiate when there was a Communion, and read that part of Service belonging to the Communion, when there was none. And when the People ſhewed much diſlike at it, becauſe it was impoſſible, as they alledg'd, that the 24th part of the Pariſh ſhould ſee or hear him, if he officiated in that place, he perſiſted in his way, and told them he would build an Altar of Stone upon his own coſt at the upper end of the Quire, and ſet it with the ends North and South, Altar-wiſe, and ſix it there, that it might not be removed upon any occaſion. A Complaint being made againſt this, by the Alderman, and a multitude of the Town, the Biſhop contented himſelf at firſt to ſend a Meſſage to the Magiſtrate, and the Vicar, that they ſhould not preſume either the one or the other of them, to move or remove that Table any more, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by ſpecial direction of him and his Chancellor; that in his Journey that way he would view the place, and accommodate the matter according to the Rubrick and Canons. There being no certain day ſet when the Biſhop would come, the Inhabitants of <hi>Grantham</hi> prevented him, and came with open cry to <hi>Bugden</hi> againſt the Vicar, who was among them at the Hearing. Some Heat, and ſharp Impeachments againſt each other being over, the Biſhop did his beſt to make them Friends, and ſupp'd them together in his great Hall, while himſelf retired to his Study, and bade them expect that he would frame ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, in a thing ſo indifferent to him, to give them content againſt the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. So he beſtowed that night in writing, and made his Papers ready by day: As the Panegyriſt ſaid to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> of ſuch Celerity, <hi>Quorum igneae &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortales mentes, mint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e ſentiunt corporis moras,</hi> p. 303. The Secretary gave a ſhort Letter to the Alderman, in which that which concerns the caſe in hand, is this little: <q>That his Lordſhip conceived that the Communion-Table, when it is not uſed, ſhould ſtand in the upper end of the Chancel, not Altar-wiſe, but Table-wiſe: But when it is uſed, either in or out of the time of Communion, it ſhould continue in the place it took up before, or be carried to any other place of Church or Chancel, where the Miniſter might be moſt audibly heard of the whole Congregation.</q> What can a Critick in Ceremonies carp at herein? What elſe, but that the end, and not the ſide of the Table ſhould ſtand toward the Miniſter when he perform'd his Liturgy? Is this all? And muſt a Controverſie as big as a Camel be drawn through the Eye of this Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? But more of the ſame comes after in a larger Script, which the Biſhop at the ſame time willed to be delivered to the Divines of the Lecture of <hi>Grantham,</hi> to be examined by them upon their next meeting-day, that their Vicar being one of their company, might read the Contents, and take a Copy for his own uſe, if he would, but to divulge it no further. Herein the Biſhop derives his Conceptions from the Injunctions, Articles, and Orders of the Queen, from the Homilies and Canons, from Reports out of the Book of Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and from the Rubricks of the Liturgy; and ſhews out of theſe, that the Utenſil on which the Holy Communion is celebrated, ought not to be an Altar, but a joyned Table; that the Name of <hi>Table</hi> is retained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the other of <hi>Altar</hi> laid aſide; that the Table (without ſome new Canon) is not to ſtand Altar-wiſe in Pariſh-Churches, and the Miniſter be at the North end thereof, but Table-wiſe, and he muſt officiate at the North ſide of the ſame; that this Table, when holy Duties are not in performing at it, muſt be laid up in the Chancel, but in the time of Service, to be removed to ſuch a place of Church or Chancel, the over-ſight of Authority appointing it, wherein he that officiates may be moſt conveniently ſeen and heard of all. They that would peruſe the whole Letter are referred to it in Print, but the ſum of it is already laid before them. And the Author was ſo little over-weening, tho'
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49492:170"/>in a frivolous caſe, that he prays the Divines to whom he ſent it, that if they found miſtakings in his Quotations, or had met with any Canons or Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions differing from the alledg'd, or did vary in their Judgment, that they would ſend their Reaſons, and they ſhould be kindly and thankfully accepted. How could a Prelate carry himſelf with more Moderation? or a Scholar write with more Modeſty? or a Variance be more ſuddenly compoſed (as it was) with more Indifferency? Did this Letter deſerve to be ript up nine years after, and torn into Raggs by an angry Cenſure? <gap reason="foreign">

This was never dreamt of by thoſe holy men, who freely called this Sacrament a Sacrifice and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Honeſta quidem, ſed ex quibus deterrima orirentur,</hi> Tac. An. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. They are excellent Notes which our Biſhop quotes out of Biſhop <hi>Bilſon, p.</hi> 116. <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles did forbear the term of Sacrifice, therefore our Faith may ſtand without it.</hi> The Speeches of the Fathers in this kind are dark and obſcure, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unuſeful for the edifying of the People. Laſtly, We find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the very Expreſſion hath been a great fomenter of Superſtition and Popery: Therefore this is an Exception at the word <hi>Altar,</hi> that it is a Relative to a Sacrifice. Dr. <hi>Heylin, Antid. p.</hi> 79. pleads for the Vicar, that in that name he aimed at no propitiatory Sacrifice. I believe him: And the like for many other of the noble Army of our Hierarchical Church; for when that Sacrifice was exploded, yet for a while Chriſt's Board was called an <hi>Altar.</hi> This was our Biſhop's mind; and, I take it, the ſame was and is in all our learned men, That in that Holy Sacrament there is a Spectacle of the Sacrifice of Chriſt's Body, as it ſuffer'd on the Croſs, repreſented by breaking the Bread, and pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out the Wine, by eating the one and drinking the other; that there is a commemoration of that Sacrifice in the repetition of the words of Inſtitution; that there is an application of that Sacrifice to their Souls, that partake by Faith; and that all this makes properly a Sacrament, improperly and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively a Sacrifice. Hereupon, leſt the notion of a Sacrifice, in this improper and ſecondary acception, ſhould be forgotten, ſome are willing blameleſly to refreſh it in their Memory, by calling the place of the repreſentation of it an <hi>Altar. Nec cuiquam ſunt injucunda quae cantant ſibi,</hi> ſays <hi>Quintil. lib.</hi> II. But ſtay there, and ſtep no further, becauſe Lauds and Thankſgivings, the ſweet odour of the Oblation of Alms, the Calves of our Lips, a broken and contrite Heart, a mortified Body, are ſpiritual Victims before and after the Sacrament, as well as in it. <hi>Sed non ibi conſiſtunt exempla ubi caeperunt,</hi> Pater. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. It is good Counſel to be ſparing in the uſe of thoſe words, whoſe elegancy and innocency cannot countervail the Errors that have encroached from them. There are ſome, I have heard it from their own Lips, who ſay, that they call this Utenſil an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, without any reference to a Sacrifice: Thus they explain themſelves; That what is ſet apart to God ſhould be differenc'd in its Name from common things,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49492:172"/>that Religion might have a Dialect proper to it ſelf, as Paten, Chalice, Corporal, Albe, Paraphront, Suffront, for the Hangings above and beneath the Table: Inſtances are innumerous, and Church-men were ever pleaſed with Terms of Art peculiar to their own Myſteries, which are not common and familiar with ſecular occaſions. But if this Project breed confuſion, it is againſt edifying; if it give Offence, it is againſt Charity. And if I may not offend my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my Meat, when I am free, that is, when my Superiors have made no Ordinance upon it; then, if I walk conſcionably, I muſt not offend him in uſurpation of words, when I am free, and ſhall not break the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Authority. I ſee not then but the word <hi>Table</hi> was to prevail, for the Goſpel brought it forch, the Church among us did more generally like it, the Canons and Rubrick ſcore it to be uſed; and if you will aſcend as high as to the Figures of the Old Teſtament, ſays the Biſhop, <hi>p.</hi> 126. not the great Altar for Sacrifice, but the Table of the Inner Temple, on which the Shew-bread was ſet, was the true Type and Preſiguration of the Communion-Table, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Jeſuits yield it.

The ſame Author hath liſted up the Quarrel again, which was fallen, about the Place of the Holy Table: I would it ſtood in any place of the Houſe of God, ſo it might be uſed, but it is extreamly diſuſed. Was there ever ſuch a negligence among Chriſtians before? Sometimes the Pope hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted the Churches of a Nation for a year or more; the greater was his Sin: But I will make Affidavit, that ſome Pariſhes among us have been interdicted from the Lord's Supper, by the Hirelings that teach them, from <hi>anno</hi> 1642. to <hi>anno</hi> 1659. and this Famine of the holy Bread is like to continue among them. Is this a Seaſon to renew what paſt <hi>anno</hi> 1637. between the Biſhop and him, how the Table ſhould ſtand? <hi>Deficilis eſt exitus veterum jurgio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Sym. Ep. p.</hi> 17. I ſpeak, as well aſſured, that the Dr. hath been often ſince that time proſtrate at that ſacred Banquet; why then doth he break out into old Grudges for their <hi>Quidlibets?</hi> Firſt, the Biſhop did deſire to ſatisfie his Reader where the holy Table ſhould ſtand, when the Communion Service was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. Secondly, where it ſhould continue when that pious work was over. For the firſt, he durſt not decide it, but as the Liturgy hath it, <hi>To ſtand in the body of the Church or Chancel, in the Communion-time, where Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Prayer be appointed to be ſaid.</hi> And as the Advertiſements ſtate it, <hi>That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer (the Communion being the ſupereminent part) be ſaid or ſung decently and diſtinctly in ſuch place as the Ordinary ſhall think meet, for the largeneſs and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Church and Quire, ſo that the People may be moſt ediſied.</hi> And as Canon 82 doth enjoyn, <hi>When the Holy Communion is to be adminiſtred, it ſhall be placed in ſo good ſort within the Church or Chancel, as thereby the Miniſter may be more convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard of the Communicants, in his Prayer and Miniſtration, and that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, and in more number, communicate with the Miniſter.</hi> And therefore the Biſhop ſums it up, <hi>Ep. p.</hi> 59. That this Liberty for a convenient place of Church or Chancel, is left to the Judgment of the Ordinary, and that the King, in his Princely Order about St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Church, did leave it to the Law, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion book, to the Canon and Dioceſan. The Law refers to <hi>Salus populi,</hi> to the edifying of the People; which was never reſpected under Popery, for their Maſs was mutter'd at high Altars, far remote from the Auditory: Which <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> maintains, <hi>H. T. p.</hi> 204. <hi>That they never meant the People ſhould underſtand any more than what they could gueſs by dumb Shews, and outward Ceremonies.</hi> In old Liturgies it appears, that not only the Clerks, but where a Church had no more than one Clerk to officiate, the People made anſwer in Verſicles and Suffrages; an excellent way to keep them in godly action; of which Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege and Comfort they have been robb'd in corrupt times, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 216. of his Ep. That King <hi>Harry</hi> 8. defended, that no Prayer was to be expected from the People; <hi>Praeteream quae ment is cogitatione Deum alloquitur.</hi> And that is it which is intended in Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi>'s Articles of his Viſitation, <hi>anno</hi> 1556. Whether the People be contemplative in holy Prayer? But we have not ſo learned

Let the Table ſtand ſo commodiouſly for the beneſit of Receivers, when it is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, and it is not here or there, whether the Miniſter ſtand at the North ſide, as the Church <hi>in terminis</hi> directs it, or at the North end, as Altar-contrivers contend for it. So we are told that the Table ſtands, and unremovably under the Eaſt Window in the King's Chappel. And ſays the Doctor, <hi>Antid. p.</hi> 41. <hi>That which is wiſely and religiouſly done in the Chappel-Royal, why ſhould it not give Law to Pariſh-Churches?</hi> The King's Chappel (I ſhould ſay was, but my Heart will not let me) is a ſacred Oratory of great regard, and ancient mention. <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> had one portable with him in his Camp. In <hi>Charles the Great</hi>'s time the Chappel of his Palace is ſamous. <hi>Luitprandus</hi> King of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> had one in his Palace; <hi>Baron. anno</hi> 744. <hi>p.</hi> 23. And in the Reign of our <hi>William</hi> Conqueſtor, we read out of his Mouth, <hi>Mea Dominica Capella,</hi> Selden. Eadm. <hi>p.</hi> 165. Such Chapels, if like to our King's in all his Courts, were of no great dimenſion; the holy Board could not ſtand no where inconveniently in them, but that all might hear; therefore one conſtant ſite was moſt decent for it, where it deſerv'd the higheſt Room, it being the Fabrick on which the principal Service Evangelical is ſolemniz'd. The Biſhop, <hi>p.</hi> 182. remembers out of <hi>Suarez,</hi> that Altars in Oratories and Chappels, among them who are the Mint-maſters of Ceremonies, are not agreeable in ſituation to the Altars in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Therefore private Chappels, nay, even the Kings, cannot be the Directories for all places, becauſe very often Pariſh Chancels being but a few ſtrides broad and long, cannot contain the multitude of all the People that come to take the Holy Myſteries. And when the Belfrey is between the Chancel and the Nave of the Church, as at <hi>Carſhalton</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> the Miniſter can neither be heard, nor ſeen, unleſs he officiate in the Church, where all may enjoy the Exhortations, behold the Conſecration, and joyn in Prayer. Therefore the Biſhop anſwers prudently, <hi>H. T. p.</hi> 34. <hi>It is not His Majeſty's Chappel, but his Laws, Rubricks, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Proclamations, which we are to follow in outward Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="105">105. Neither can the Opponent appeal to Rubrick and Canons, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes him to an Order, wherein the King's Majeſty was preſent at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Table, <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 1633. This is quoted at length, <hi>Antid. p.</hi> 62. and in ſome of his latter Works, for approving the Table to be removed from the middle of the Chancel to the upper end, and there to be placed Altar-wiſe. If the King had intended that the like ſhould be obſerved in all Parochial Churches, the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been decided againſt the Biſhop's Letter. <hi>Nec turpe eſt ab eo vinci, quem vincere eſſet nefas,</hi> as <hi>Tigranes</hi> ſays of <hi>Pompey, Velle. lib.</hi> 1. The Biſhop ſubſcribes, <hi>p.</hi> 163. That <hi>the addition of any more Ceremonies than are preſcribed in our Book, is referred to the perſon of the King by Act of Parliament.</hi> The Contention remains, whether that Order of His Majeſty with his Council hath influence upon other places, beſide the particular of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> which occaſion'd it. The Dr. himſelf ſays no ſuch matter directly, but, <hi>Antid. p.</hi> 36. <hi>The King did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but hath given encouragement to the Metropolitan, and Biſhops, and other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, to require the like in all Churches committed to them.</hi> The Biſhop ſays, <hi>He hath left all to the Law, to the Communion-book, to the Canons and Dioceſan,</hi> p. 59. And which is much they two ſhould agree, the Doctor ſays ſo too, <hi>Ant. p.</hi> 64. <hi>That it is left to the Judgment of the Ordinary, for the thing, for the time</hi> (N. B.) <hi>when, and how long he may find cauſe.</hi> The Biſhop ſays more, <hi>That after this Order he had heard of no Biſhop that had exacted of his Dioceſs the placing of the Holy Table Altar-wiſe,</hi> p. 69. And in the year following, 1634. the Archbiſhop holding a Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political Viſitation, keeps him to the ancient form in this Interrogatory, <hi>Doth the Table ſtand in a convenient place of Chancel or Church?</hi> If one Prelate was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in his Viſitation of <hi>Norwich</hi> Dioceſs, which the Dr. would ſeem not to ſpeak out, but to intimate, our Biſhop hath a Paſſage to meet it, <hi>p.</hi> 85. out of Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift; There is no manner of reaſon, that the Orders of the Church ſhould depend upon one or two mens liking or diſliking,</hi> Where now appears, I ſay not the Command, but the Encouragement, that the Order made for St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Church ſhould be obſerved in all Pariſhes? It will conduce to this Cauſe, to borrow one Quotation out of the Biſhop, and two out of the Doctor; the Biſhop's is taken from an Act of Council made for reformation, 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>That the form of a Table ſhall never move the ſimple from the ſuperſtitious Opinions of the Popiſh Maſs;</hi> and <hi>that this ſuperſtitious Opinion is more held in the minds of the ſimple and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49492:173"/>by the form of an Altar, than of a Table.</hi> The Dr. <hi>p.</hi> 105. out of a Sermon of Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi>'s, preach'd before K. <hi>Edward, It were well it might pleaſe the Magiſtrates to turn the Altars into Tables, according to the firſt Inſtitution of Chriſt, to take away the falſe Perſwaſion of the People, which they have of Sacrifices to be done upon the Altars; for as long as the Altars remain, both the ignorant People, and the ignorant evil-perſwaded Prieſt will dream always of Sacrifice.</hi> Then <hi>p.</hi> 129. Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> took down Altars, and appointed the form of a right Table to be uſed in all his Dioceſs, <hi>Duo Scipiadae.</hi> Theſe two Biſhops were very learned, and very Martyrs. A little remains to ſhut up this Controverſie, or rather to ſhut it out: For to ſet the Table under the Eaſt Window of the Chancel, the ends running North and South, is this to ſet it Altar-wiſe? Verily it is a meer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Phraſe, or rather an Engliſh Error, becauſe Altars beyond the Seas are placed promiſcuouſly, either at the top, or in the midſt of the Chancel; as the Biſhop notes <hi>p.</hi> 218. and commonly ſo far from the Wall, that the Prieſts and Deacons might ſtand round about them: As in Cardinal <hi>Borromaeo</hi>'s Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſpace of eight cubits was to be left between the Altar and the Wall. <hi>Altare in medio Eccleſiae ſitum,</hi> ſays <hi>Baron. anno</hi> 451. <hi>p.</hi> 62. <hi>Joſephus Vicecomes,</hi> a skilful man in theſe punctilio's, <hi>Altaria in medio Eccleſiae allocata fuiſſe.</hi> But to faſten it ſure, I refer it to <hi>Marcellus Corcyrenſis, lib.</hi> 3.

So far the Petition: I will not teach the Reader what Sallads to pick out of it, but only the Herb of Grace, that the Biſhop kiſt the King's Hand upon the aſſurance of his Peace; that the Offence which was taken was buried, and ſhould never riſe up in Judgment more: <hi>Nihil periculi Soloni à Piſiſtrato,</hi> Diog. Laert. Now, who ever liked <hi>Julian</hi> the Cardinal, that made <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> K. of <hi>Polonia</hi> break his League with the <hi>Turk?</hi> And who will defend B. <hi>L.</hi> that made his Soveraign break his word with his Subject? It was he, and none elſe, that put in an unſeaſonable Bar to hinder <hi>Lincoln</hi> the fulneſs of the Benefit. I know none that had the neareſt part in B. <hi>L</hi>'s Favour, that can deny it: And let them turn it about as they will, is it poſſible they ſhould excuſe it? <gap reason="foreign">

Let the King do Righteous Judgment like God, in whoſe Throne he ſits; before whom this holds inviolable, <hi>Peccata dimiſſa nunquam redeunt:</hi> No, not original Sin, when remitted in Baptiſm, it ſhall not be imputed to them any more, that are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for actual Crimes, whereof they did not repent.

                  <p n="111">111. Deſtiny is unavoidable. A Bill is filed in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for the King, for Revealing his Councils. The Defendant made him ready for his Anſwer, and plyed the King with Petitions together; in Parody like <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aeneas, Et ſe collegit in arma—Poplite ſubſidens.</hi> At firſt he tried Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> if he would be ſo generous as to heal the Wound that he had made, and anointed him with the Weapon-Salve of remembrance of Friendſhip paſt, and proteſtation of the like for ever; he courted him to mediate for him. And was it not likely he would think, who had procured him his firſt Rochet, well fring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good <hi>Commendums?</hi> But what Suſpicion, to find a thankful Man did bring <hi>Lincoln</hi> into this Error? <gap reason="foreign">

This Hand return'd him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from his Majeſty but Denials and Deſpairs; as if he had lighted upon one of the <hi>Genethliaci,</hi> or Figure-Caſters, that never portend a good Horoſcope to any; or as I may better ſet it down in <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>'s Complaint, <hi>De Pareliis p.</hi> 309. <hi>Ita praepoſteri ſumus, ut nunquam captemus bona omina.</hi> A good word from ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious an Agent would have cleared any man, who made <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Fidelity more ſuſpected to his Royal Maſter. Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> knew him, how ſtrong he was in his Intellectuals, how fit to manage Civil and Church Affairs, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as <hi>Tully</hi> tranſlates it out of <hi>Aratus, Huic non una modo caput ornans ſtella relucet.</hi> He thought it a diſparagement to have a Parage with any of his Rank; and out of Emulation did dry his Subſtance, that it might not flow ſo faſt into Charitable Works. Therefore as the Oratour wrote to <hi>Atticus, Qui mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi pennas inciderunt, nolunt eaſdem renaſci,</hi> ſo he kept the Feathers of the other ſhort, that they might not grow again, to fly before him. <hi>Lincoln</hi> took it not a whit to heart, becauſe he foreſaw it. I have heard him ſay, <hi>Though I did as much for him as I could, when he wanted me; yet I knew he would fail, if ever I wanted him.</hi> What remedy but the Cauſe, which had rotted three years in the Dung, muſt now be made ripe? a Miſchief which had lyen like a Match kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to give fire to a Train of Powder long after. So it came to be ſifted by the great Abilities of Mr. <hi>William Noy</hi> Attorney General, a Man of Cynical beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but of an honeſt heart to his Friends and Clients, and both together did become him. This famous Lawyer profeſt a great averſeneſs from dealing in this Cauſe: for he wanted a Ground to plead upon. The Defendant maintains that he had opened no Counſels of the Kings; but what he ſpake to <hi>Lamb</hi> and <hi>Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> was Parliamentary Communication. Let the Peers and Commons look to it; it concerns them all that their Priviledges be maintain'd, to be unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for thoſe things which paſt from one to another at that ſeaſon; who, by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49492:177"/>the Writ that Summons them, do meet as Counſellors for great Affairs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church and Commonwealth. And by this very Demurrer Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> about two years before, had quaſh't a Bill which was preferr'd in the <hi>Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> againſt him in a like Accuſation. Neither contemn the Inconvenience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtorm fell upon one Biſhop, and no more. The whole Tree was as good as unfaſtned, when one Bough was ſhaken. It is a good Caution in <hi>Ariſt.</hi> 5. <hi>Polit.</hi>

                     </gap>, It is all aſſumed to ſay, The Danger is not great that lights upon one or two Particulars, when by that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance it will break in upon the whole Kind. Be it known therefore, that this Bill was kept under Hatches, and never came to hearing: For which way could the Council ſtir to plead upon it?

But in this charge let Wit and Learning turn it ſelf every way, there was no Bottom to build upon. Therefore Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> after two years, grew weary of it, and ſlackned the Proſecution. He died untimely for our Biſhop's good, who acknowledgeth it under his Hand, That he dealt fairly with him: not reckoning by his Maundings and rough Language, which came from him to pleaſe the ſuperviſing Prelate. But <hi>Lincoln</hi> never felt harm from him, whoſe Finger he cut but with the back of his Knife. Therefore I pronounce him innocent of this Man's ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, upon the reaſon that <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> ſpared <hi>Terpiades, Odyſſ.</hi>

Here's one that wore that Badge: and our Biſhop writes more, and Truth in all, <hi>That in ſcorn of Juſtice, for many years, he lived from his own Wife, a vertuous and well-born Gentlewoman, whom he had ſtol'n away from her Parents, and lived in open Adultery with another Man's Wife, one Mr.</hi> Bines, <hi>hard by</hi> White-hall, <hi>and begot divers Baſtards upon her Body, beſides his other Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and Infamies of all kinds.</hi> This Man, as himſelf avouched, was found out, and employed by Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> (by this time he is in that Throne) by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Windebank</hi> and Sir <hi>J.

This Fellow interloping into the Proſecution of the Cauſe, diſturb'd it in every point of the due Proceeding, left not one Rule or Practice of the Court unbroken, menacing, and intimidating Witneſſes, Clerks, Regiſters, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers, Judges, and the Lord keeper himſelf.

Thirdly, The ſame Secretary directed one <hi>Peachy,</hi> a Meſſenger of the Chamber, (ſtart not at it Reader, for 'tis true) to attend <hi>Kilvert</hi> in his Coat of Arms, all along with the Commiſſion, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and cloſe impriſon ſuch as <hi>Kilvert</hi> ſhould appoint, pretending Matters of State, and of deep conſequence againſt them.

After a long Argument of five hours at the leaſt, the Court did all vote, (except the Archbiſhop, and the L. <hi>F.</hi>) that the Defence ſhould remain undiſpunged, for elſe an unavoidable Miſchief would follow to all the King's Subjects, that being accuſed by two deſperate Witneſſes, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs in that high Court, if they may not be called in queſtion by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant for their Acts and Honeſties.

Yet this Order, though ſmother'd and buried, made an end of this firſt Cauſe; for the Combination of the four Contrivers was not held meet to come abroad into pleading, who would have fallen to pieces with a little ſhaking, that thought to lay the dead Child in the Biſhop's Boſom, while he ſlept; but their Patron had a care to keep them from Scandal, and that they knew.

Our Biſhop's Reſolution ſtuck not in thoſe Briers, who ſaw that this Offer proceeded out of the ſtreights of his Occaſions: Though no Evil were found in him, yet if the King's Power conteſt, who can ſtand upright? And if Malice will take no ſatisfaction but Ruin, the moſt innocent muſt fall: The L. Keeper, a good man, was over-balanc'd; the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> was become like the Tribunal of <hi>L.

The Secretary was prepared for any Execution, yet the Biſhop gives him this Praiſe in his Notes, <hi>That he was a modeſt and a virtuous Gentleman, but in this Cauſe ſet on by his Maker.</hi> Therefore the Biſhop is content to ſatisfie the King's Demands, that is, to pitch and pay. The firſt Condition brought to him by the <hi>L. Cottington,</hi> was to part with 4000 <hi>l.</hi> with his Deanry, and two inconſiderable <hi>Commenda's.

Well, I will ſatisfie the King,</hi> ſays <hi>Lincoln, and I will ſell ſome Land for it.</hi> The Match is ſtruck, done 'tis, and the Biſhop as good as undone by it. He delighted to do charitable Works, but this would ſear the Vein, that it could run no more. It was a ſweet Apophthegm, which I heard come from him when all was exhauſted: <hi>I care not for Poverty, but I ſhall not be able to requite a Benefit; God grant every good King a better way than this was, to enrich him.

But the King's Counſel peruſing the Depoſitions, waved it, and gave it another form, Seducing of Witneſſes, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt injury to the atteſtation of Truth, and for contraction in a new phraſe, Tampering with Witneſſes, as my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> called it in his Sentence, Perhaps it is not Subornation of Perjury, but it is Tampering. The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant thought to help himſelf with a Demur upon four Heads: Firſt, That it was utterly againſt the Practice of the Court, from the Foundation of it, to fall upon a new Charge, ſtarted out of a former, before the firſt had been heard. 2. That advantage was taken to undo any man living, to gather new Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of the Books, after the publication of the precedent Cauſe. 3. That for all that was offer'd to the Court, complaint had been openly made by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and not diſproved, That it roſe from the Proſecutors miſ-leading and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Witneſſes, whom Terrour and Impriſonment would not ſuffer to be conſtant to themſelves.

Laſtly, The Biſhop pleaded with Animoſity (<hi>quid enim loqueretur</hi> Achilles? <hi>Ovid.

How that Court dealeth not with any offence, which is not <hi>Malum in ſe,</hi> againſt the Common Law; or <hi>Malum prohibitum,</hi> againſt ſome Statute. And that Novelties without warrant of Praeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, are not to be allowed. Aſſume now out of the Premiſes, that no Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could be found, that the cenſorious magnificence of the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> had ever tamper'd with ſuch a <hi>peccatulum</hi> as tampering. Alteration in the forms of a Court beget the Corruption of the Subſtance.

But ſays <hi>Symmachus</hi> in <hi>Ep. p.</hi> 14. <hi>Si adjici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur inſolita, forſan conſueta ceſſabunt.</hi> When the People are over-lay'd with new Diſcipline, perhaps the old Seats of Juſtice may crack in pieces. The Lord Keeper knew Juſtice, and loved it; and did not obſcurely ſignifie, that he thought the Demur was reaſonable: which had almoſt removed him. And he found by one occurrence, that the Biſhop's Caſe was to be ſevered from other mens: For whereas a Proclamation came forth in <hi>October</hi> 1636. that becauſe a Plague was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49492:180"/>begun in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> therefore all Pleas and Suits in Law ſhould be ſuſpended till <hi>Hillary</hi> Term was opened, and the Biſhop claimed the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that all things might be reſpited about his Cauſe, branched out into ten Heads, till that ſeaſon. <hi>The Proclamation indeed is full and clear on your ſide,</hi> ſays the Lord Keeper, <hi>but I have ſpecial directions, that you ſhall have no benefit thereof. And I tell you as a Friend, if you rely upon the Proclamation, your impriſonment is aimed at.</hi> As if there were one Rule of Juſtice for all the Subjects in the Land, and another for this Biſhop; who took his qu. from this Caveat to attend his Buſineſs; and he did it with the more confidence, that in ſeven years his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries had got no ground of him; as <hi>Grotius</hi> writes of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſiege at <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Charge in debate, without any favour to the Defendant, is thus compriſed: <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. when <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> wanted Water to turn his Mill, Sir <hi>John Mounſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Farmery,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> offer'd themſelves to debauch the Credit of <hi>Pregion,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Witneſs; who both expected to have gained, and did gain almoſt as much as <hi>Kilvert</hi> by the Avenues of the Cauſe. To bring their Contrivance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, a Baſtard is laid to <hi>Pregion,</hi> to be begotten of the Body of <hi>Elizabeth Hodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and that he bribed her to lay it upon another Father. The Biſhop was to defend the Credit of his Witneſs, and had to do with Matters and Perſons in this Point, wherein himſelf was altogether a Stranger. He ſuſpected ill deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Sir <hi>J. Mounſon,</hi> the great Stickler, becauſe he knew he hated <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> for caſting a Scandal upon his Lady, as vertuous a Gentlewoman as the Country had; in which Cauſe the Biſhop had cauſed <hi>Pregion</hi> to give Satisfaction long before. Then he had more aſſurance of <hi>Pregions</hi> Innocency, becauſe he was clear'd of this Baſtard in a Seſſions held at <hi>Lincoln</hi> in <hi>May, Car.</hi> 9. and whereas it came again into debate at the Seſſions 3 <hi>Octob.</hi> following, and it was given out that an Order was paſt to find <hi>Pregion</hi> guilty, the Biſhop was certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Order was not drawn up in open Court, and that it was inſerted in many places with <hi>Farmeries</hi> hand. And <hi>Thomas Lund</hi> being preſent at the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, aſſerted, <hi>That it was not conſented to by the Juſtices, but drawn out of Sir</hi> J. Mounſon's <hi>pocket.</hi> He had Letters from Knights of far greater Eſtates than Sir <hi>John,</hi> who likewiſe teſtified the ſame; and from Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> the Clerk of the Peace, who refuſed to enter that Order; and that it was excepted againſt in open Seſſions by Mr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> a Counſellor of the Laws, and by the greater part of the Bench, as utterly illegal. So that afterward being tried at the <hi>King's Bench</hi> for the illegality of it, it was damned by all the four Judges. Yet more to detect the Corruption of that Order, at the next Seſſions held in <hi>May,</hi> the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices diſcharged <hi>Pregion,</hi> and laid the baſe Child upon one <hi>Booth</hi> a Recuſant, a Kinſman of Sir <hi>J. Mounſon</hi>'s; which Judgment was ſo inerrable, that it was proved by three Witneſſes, <hi>That upon the very day that the Biſhop was ſentenced,</hi> Booth <hi>himſelf confeſt, in the hearing of thoſe Witneſſes, that</hi> Pregion <hi>had nothing to do with that baggage Woman, but that he, the ſaid</hi> Booth, <hi>at ſuch a time and place, did get her with Child, and that</hi> Kilvert, <hi>whom he curſed bitterly, had promiſed him half the Fine to charge the Child upon</hi> Pregion, <hi>and had not performed it; and did vainly brag, that</hi> Kilvert <hi>had brought him to kiſs the King's hand.</hi> This was detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the ſad day was over. <hi>Et inſtaurant dolorem ſera ſolatia,</hi> Sym. p. 86. But the Objection lay not only upon the getting of the Child, but how that <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> or rather the Biſhop, had carried themſelves, to entangle the Witneſſes that had ſworn againſt <hi>Pregion,</hi> which was the main Charge of the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the colour for the heavy Sentence. The Biſhop being authorized from the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> to uphold the Credit of his Witneſs, he found the Depoſitions of <hi>Lund, Wetheral, Alice Smith,</hi> and <hi>Anne Tubb</hi> to preſs upon <hi>Pregion.

                     </gap>, <hi>Xeno. Ath. Reſp.</hi> 'Tis pardonable for every man to help himſelf. Nor was it an indirect way, no not a jot; for there was neither Perjury nor Contradiction found between the firſt and ſecond Depoſitions of the Parties: And what the Biſhop did was by the advice of the beſt Counſel in <hi>England,</hi> to draw up ſome few Interrogatories to be put to the four Witneſſes, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to interpret, and not to vary from, or to ſubſtract, or contradict what they had depoſed before: For the words being ambiguous in themſelves, might be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49492:181"/>taken in one ſenſe to Defame, in another fence not at all to touch upon the credit of <hi>Pregion.</hi> It was agreed that <hi>Pregion</hi> offer'd money to <hi>A. Tubb,</hi> and <hi>Alice Smith</hi> to procure <hi>Eliz. Hodgſon</hi> to lay the baſe Child upon another man; this they had ſworn: this the Biſhop never endeavoured to impeach. But an interrogatory is drawn up, and offer'd to them, whether <hi>El. Hodgſon</hi> was dealt with to lay it upon the right Father, (which was a juſt and lawful motion) or upon ſome other, whether he had been the Father or no. They both anſwer, That <hi>Pregion</hi> ſollicited her to lay it upon another, that was the true Father. And this variation is all the Offence, that is, none at all, in that particular. And in that right meaning Sir <hi>J. Wray,</hi> Sir <hi>J. Bolls,</hi> and <hi>Richardſon</hi> the Clerk of the Peace, did receive it in the Seſſions. This Practice, ſo little as it is, is the grand Objection, all beſide comes not to ſo much as a filip on the Forehead: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, one <hi>Ward</hi> ſwears, that he heard a Servant of the Biſhop, <hi>C. Powel,</hi> offer <hi>Alice Smith</hi> Monies to take an Oath of his framing; but <hi>Alice</hi> ſwears directly it was not ſo. <hi>Powel</hi> ſwears he offer'd and paid her Money to bear her Charges, as a Witneſs, which is fit and lawful. <hi>Nec iſt a benignitas adimenda eſt, quae libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem magis ſignificat, quàm largitionem,</hi> Cic. pro Murenâ. <hi>T. Lund</hi> takes his Oath, That <hi>Pregion</hi> told him, that he never had touch'd <hi>El Hodgson</hi> but twice: Being demanded hereof more ſtrictly in his examination in the <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> he ſwears, That <hi>Pregion</hi> did not ſay to him, that he touch'd her carnally, nor did he know what he meant by touching. Is there either ſubſtraction or contradiction in this? or any more than a plain interpretation? <hi>Laſtly, Wetheral</hi> had depoſed, That he was entreated by <hi>Pregion</hi> not to be at the Seſſions: He ſtands to it, but adds, that he was not bound to be there, nor ſummoned: He had depoſed, That <hi>Pregion</hi> ſpake to him to ſwear to no more, than the Court ſhould ask him. What harm was there in that Caution? Being examined in <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> he ſwears, That <hi>Pregion</hi> tempted him to nothing by Bribes or Reward, but that he told him, if he were ſworn to tell the whole Truth, he would not conceal it. Only one Witneſs, <hi>George Walker,</hi> layeth it on the Biſhop, how <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Richard Owen</hi> entreated him in the Biſhop's Name to ſpeak with <hi>Witheral</hi> upon theſe matters; which though it include no ill, yet <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Powel</hi> depoſe, They were never employed by the Biſhop to deal with <hi>G. Walker</hi> upon ſuch an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. So the Biſhop is cleared in every Information by ſufficient Oaths of ſuch, againſt whoſe Faith there was no exception. How eaſie a Province had the Defendant's Counſel to crumble theſe Impeachments into Duſt, and to blow them into the Eyes of the Impeachers? <hi>Verba innocenti reperire facilè eſt,</hi> Curt. <hi>lib.</hi> 6. Yet the Oratory of the Court, by pre-inſtructions, did turn them into filthy Crimes. As <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſays in the beginning of his Work, <hi>That out of the ſame Jewels, which being handſomly put together make the Image of a</hi> Prince, <hi>being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aſunder, you may contrive them into the Shape of a</hi> Monſter.</p>
                  <p n="119">119. Could it be expected that ſuch Driblets, or rather Phantoms of Under-dealing with Witneſſes, ſhould hold the Court ten days hearing, in the long Vacation after Trinity-Term? What leiſure was taken to bolt out, to exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate, to wrack, to diſtort, to make an Elephant of a Fly! which I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pour forth in the words of <hi>Tully</hi> for his Client, <hi>Quintius de fortunis omnibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbandus eſt. Potentes, diſerti, nobiles, omnes advocandi. Adhibenda vis eſt verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, minae intentantur, pericula intenduntur, formidines opponuntur.</hi> But here were worſe things, which the Oratour had never cauſe to complain of under the Roman Laws. All the Depoſitions of the main Witneſſes for the Biſhop were deleted, not fairly by a Hearing in open Court, where their Lordſhips might every one have conſider'd of it, but were ſpunged out by that Judge in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chamber, who was the bane of the Cauſe from the beginning to the end; and forſooth, becauſe they were impertinent Scandals againſt <hi>Kilvert,</hi> and others that had depoſed for the King: Only the Biſhop was allowed to put in a croſs Bill when it was too late, after he was firſt ruin'd in his Honour, Fortunes, and Liberty, and then leſt to ſeek a Remedy againſt a Companion not worth a Groat. And who was ever uſed like this Defendant ſince the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> ſate? that when his Cauſe was ſo far proceeded, as to be heard in three ſittings, that two new Affidavits ſhould be brought in by <hi>Kilvert,</hi> which ſtruck to the very ſubſtance of the Cauſe, to which no Anſwer could be given, becauſe they were new matters, quite out of the Books, obtruded long after publication, yet from thenceforth produced every day, which ſeduced divers of the noble Lords, and no doubt many of the Hearers, as though they had been Depoſitions in that Cauſe, which were not ſo, but Materials of another information, and in their
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49492:181"/>due time were fully cleared and diſproved. When was it known before, that in every of the ten days that the Cauſe was in debate, a Cloſet-meeting was held at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> the Lords ſent for to it one by one, the Proofs there repeated to them, and their Votes beſpoken? Which was no better than when <hi>Junius Marius,</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> beſpake the Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> to impart his private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries unto him, <hi>Per quos noſceret quiſque quem accuſandum popoſciſſet.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the full hearing and ſentencing the Cauſe, the Lords were well told a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, That a noble Perſonage had offered Ten thouſand pounds to compound for the Biſhop's Peace, (which is true, that the Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> did it, when he ſaw how the Game went in the Cabinet.) Which was the very reaſon that induced their Lordſhips to lay ſuch an immenſe Fine upon a Fault conceiv'd, that was never ſentenc'd in any Kingdom or State before. Yet all this did not ſuffice, but in that morning of the day, when the Cauſe was ſentenc'd, it was firſt debated in an inner Chamber, ſo long till many hundreds waited for their coming forth till high noon, wherein Agreement was concluded by all Parties before they ſate. There, and then it was, that the Archbiſhop preſs'd for the degradation of his Brother Biſhop, and his deportation, God knows whither. Now, to decline that Extremity, the moſt of the Lords, who endeavour'd to do all the Favour that they durſt ſhew, concluded upon a Fine of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment in the <hi>Tower</hi> during Pleaſure, (which had been but ſhort, as they were aſſured before, if the King had been but left to his own gracious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and to be ſuſpended during Pleaſure, in the High-Commiſſion-Court, from all his Juriſdiction: Which Suſpenſion paſs'd in that Commiſſion <hi>July</hi> 23. And it would not be paſs'd over, that Sir <hi>Ed. Littleton,</hi> then L. Chief-Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas, Anno</hi> 1640. in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> brought <hi>Lincoln</hi> to <hi>Lambeth</hi> face to face, with the L. of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> when <hi>Lincoln</hi> told his Grace, <hi>That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under the Great Seal had not a word in it to enable him to ſuſpend either Biſhop or Prieſt by direction from a Sentence of</hi> Star-chamber, <hi>but only for Offences ſpecified in the Commiſſion;</hi> and <hi>that the Fact which His Grace had done, had brought him and the Commiſſioners into a Praemunire.</hi> To which the Archbiſhop anſwered, <hi>That he had never read the Commiſſion.</hi> A learned Satisfaction; Was it not? when he had cenſur'd ſo many by the Power of that Commiſſion, which he confeſt he had never read.

So this Lord look'd on the Biſhop's Cauſe not only with a blear'd but with a blood-ſhotten Eye; for it was conceived he meant the cutting off his Ears, who had never ſate a Judge, in all likelihood, if this Biſhop, being then L. Keeper, had not prevented him from leaving his Calling, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling beyond Seas; from which courſes he kept him, by fair Promiſes to provide for him, and he made them good: I will name the time and place, <hi>Aug.</hi> 1621, and the Earl of <hi>Exeter</hi>'s Houſe in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Cloſe.

Then comes in the Archbiſhop with a Trick, to hoiſe up the Biſhop with ſome Praiſe, that it might puſh him in pieces with a greater Cenſure, That when he thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Delinquent's Learning, Wiſdom, Agility in Diſpatch, Memory, and Experience, that accompanied him with all theſe Endowments, he wondred at his Follies and Sins in this Cauſe. O Sins by all means! for by dioptrical Glaſſes ſome find Blemiſhes in the Sun: <hi>Teleſcopia fabri facimus ut in ſole maculas quaeramus,</hi> ſays <hi>Alex.

Another thing came ſo croſs to the Biſhop, as nothing could be worſe to a magnificent ſumptuous mind; and if he had been covetous, it had done the Work which his Enemy lookt for, it had killed him.

It was time for him to ſave ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, if he could, to keep him in a competency of Livelihood.

Thus a brave Perſonal Eſtate flew away into Atoms, and not a Tally ſtruck to pay His Majeſty, though enough to have paid all, if it had been juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly husbanded. The worſt is behind. The Biſhop's Benefices, Lands, and Leaſes are offer'd to be rented at 4500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> with ſufficient Security to pay the King: This had ſatisfied the Fine in two years, within a little.

Well might they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Biſhop, at this rate, 500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> out of his own, for his ſubſiſtence; and yet of that the Fees of the Priſon ſuck'd up a conſiderable proportion: But <hi>Kilvert</hi> was a long-tongu'd fellow, and if he were alive, he would ſpeak out, and tell us, <hi>That there were Sharers with him in theſe Prizes, he had not all.</hi> He and <hi>Powel</hi> were Sequeſtrators indeed, to collect the Rents of <hi>Huntington ſhire,</hi> but <hi>Farmery</hi> had thoſe of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Sir <hi>J.

But thus he was given up to be devoured, as a Carrion, by his Promoters and Accuſers. And what Conſcience was there in the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſuch partial Sequeſtrators?

Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> our Biſhop's Secretary, hardly eſcap'd in the ſecond Bill, and <hi>Kilvert</hi>'s anger did ſtill hang over him. <hi>Cadwallader Powel</hi> his Steward was then fined at 300 <hi>l.</hi> and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, yet was never toucht in his perſon, nor a peny of the Fine exacted of him. For which Favours he is dealt with to eſpy what he could, to cruſh his Lord with ſome freſh Oppreſſion. Who raking in every Corner to find out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that might anſwer his Undertaking, he produceth two Letters of Mr. <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolſtons,</hi> the head School-maſter of the King's School at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to whom they are written, will not own them, that he did ever receive them. <hi>Powel</hi> ſays he found them in his Chamber.

But it was made highly probable, that theſe Letters were neither found, ſcatter'd at random, nor pick't out of a Desk or Hamper of Papers, (both which for certain <hi>Powel</hi> broke open) but <hi>Powel</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49492:184"/>them immediately from the Carrier, and never deliver'd them to his Lord and Maſter. So it was confirm'd by many Oaths in Court; nay, confeſt by <hi>Powel, That when his Lord was in remoter parts, he had order to open all Letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to his Lordſhip, to look into them if they had any matter concerning the Suits ſo hotly proſecuted againſt him, and to ſend them, as he thought fit, to the Secretary to</hi> London. The Contents of theſe two Letters being gloſt upon by <hi>Powel</hi> to be dangerous to the Archbiſhop, and lap'd up in dark folds to give a greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright, it founds likely that he reſerved them to himſelf, and kept them in laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for ſuch a day wherein they might ſtand him in ſtead. For more confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Biſhop takes his Oath, <hi>He did not remember that ever he received ſuch Letters:</hi> and <hi>Osbolſton</hi> ſwears point blank, <hi>He never had an anſwer to them;</hi> which makes a ſtrong preſumption, that this truſty Steward did pocket them up. Of whom <hi>Kilvert</hi> received them; which is not denied. And he preſents them to his Grace: and if his Grace had been the Maſter of a brave Spirit, we would have thrown them into the ſire. That had been generous to abhor a Servant that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd his Maſter, and to borrow no Office of Villany from him.

For if he receive ſuch Letters, and not complain of them, if it come to light, diſtortions of Phraſes ſhall endanger him to be guilty of ſmothering a Libel.

But the Biſhop pleads he never received ſuch Letters to his remembrance; and to make it likely, <hi>Osbolſton</hi> ſwears he never had an Anſwer of them. <hi>Powel</hi> will not ſwear, but ſays he found them in a Band-box in the Biſhop's Chamber. They were like the Cup in <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s Sack, no body but <hi>Joſeph</hi> and the Steward that plotted it, could tell how it came there.

And he was right, that the Paper is very candid, and did deſerve from the Archbiſhop that he ſhould have caſt away at leaſt ſome unprofitable courteſies upon the Biſhop for it. And the proof was clear, even <hi>ex parte Reg is</hi> in the Court, that he refuſed to conſent or agree to make one in a quarrel againſt the Archbiſhop: but he holds cloſe to his main Plea, <hi>That the Letters excepted at did never come to his hands.</hi> If the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them be worthy of a cenſure, let it light upon his Steward, and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, who confeſs to have ſeen thoſe Papers ſome years before, and to know the ironical meaning, and did conceal them. He appeals alſo to the Laws of the Land, that if ſuch Letters had come to him, like <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Rhimes, and Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruſian bumbaſt, that no Law or Practice directs the Subject to bring ſuch Gryphes and Oracles, but plain, litteral, grammatical Notions of Libels to a Juſtice of Peace, againſt a known and clearly decipher'd Magiſtrate.

All that he had done, and he had done to his beſt, is not allow'd; his Anſwers are again return'd to be inſufficient, yet not challeng'd in a word for ſuch and ſuch Omiſſions, or Tergiverſations: for which an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercement of 40 <hi>s.</hi> was the moſt that could be exacted by Rule. That's all one; he is committed cloſe Priſoner to his Chamber, with order that neither Counſellor or Sollicitor ſhould come near him, or ſend to him.

The Biſhop lying in Priſon, and ſuſtaining the heavy weight of the firſt Cenſure, <hi>July</hi> 11. 1637. he preſs'd the L. <hi>Coventry</hi> to move His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for ſome mitigation of the Fine, and to ſtop the violent levying of it, ſince it ſtood in no proportion with the Charges of the Bill, or the Preſidents of the Court. Hereupon His Majeſty tells the L. Keeper, he would admit of no ſuch motion, but by the Mediation of the Queen. The Biſhop is glad of the News, and could call to mind, that in greater matters than this, Princely Ladies had
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49492:187"/>the Honour to make the Accord, which the greateſt Stateſmen had attempted in vain; as Madam <hi>Loviſe,</hi> Mother of K. <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and Madam <hi>Margaret,</hi> Aunt to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Regent of the Low Countries, made up that Peace between the Emperor and the King, which other Mediators had given over for deſperate. Our Queen endeavour'd a Meſſage of Clemency, but that Honour was denied her. The Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> writes in her Name to the Biſhop, That all ſhe could obtain of the King, was, that if he would be bandied no more in <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> 1. He muſt leave his Biſhoprick and Deanry, and all his Commendams, and take a Biſhoprick in <hi>Ireland</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> as His Majeſty pleaſed. 2. He muſt recant his Book. 3. Secure all his Fine. 4. Never queſtion any that had been employed by His Majeſty againſt him. Strange Phyſick as ever was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, for it was a Pill as big as a Pumpion; and whoſe Throat could ſwallow it down? <hi>Non eſt pax, ſed ſervitutis pactio,</hi> Tul.

The worſt that all the Courts in <hi>England</hi> could do, could not impoſe ſuch Terms upon him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, to yield thus far were to fly the Field, and to receive an inglorious wound in his Back. Then he falls upon other Thoughts, that he would pleaſe the King, by making an unparallel'd Submiſſion to him: And were it not beſt to be content with half a Ruine, to prevent a whole? He muſt be a loſer; yet a man ſpends nothing, that buys that he hath need of. So he wrote back to the ſame Earl, that he would lay his Biſhoprick and Deanry at His Majeſty's Feet, but excuſed his going into <hi>Ireland.</hi> To the ſecond, That he could not recant his Book, which contain'd no Doctrine that he was not ready to juſtifie. To the third, He would pay his Fine as he was able. To the fourth he ſubmitted.

For the Proportion what he ſhould have to live upon riſing out of his own Eſtate, he muſt know nothing, till he had wholly ſubmitted. From that hour the falſe Glaſs, wherein the Biſhop ſaw a ſhadow of Peace, was broken: And he writes to the Earl in the Stile of a man, That <hi>it were a tempting of God to part with all he had willingly, and leave himſelf no aſſurance of a Livelihood: That his Debts, if he came out of the Priſon of the</hi> Tower, <hi>would caſt him into another Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no better proviſion being made for them, than he ſaw appearance for: That he would never hazard himſelf into a condition to beg his Bread.</hi> Truly he had cauſe to look for better Offers, and ſince they came not, he would lay his Head upon the Pillow of Hope, till he had ſlept his laſt: He had not ſuffer'd as an Evil man, his Conſcience bore him witneſs, whereby he was not obnoxious to Infamy: <hi>Majore poenâ affectus quàm legibus ſtatutum eſt, non eſt infamis;</hi> a Maxim of Reaſon and of Law in our Kingdom. To ſurrender up all he had, were to ſuffer as a Fool. <hi>Plato</hi> is made the Author of the Saying, <hi>That he had rather leave ſomewhat to his Enemies when he died, than ſtand in need of his Friends, who might prove no Friends while he lived.</hi> But this is ſurely <hi>Plato</hi>'s in <hi>Apol. pro Socr.</hi> That when <hi>Socrates</hi> was ask'd, how he felt himſelf affected, when he was wrongfully condemn'd, he ſaid,

Our biſhop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted day and night at his Study with Hiſtories of Saints in by-paſt Ages, and knew they had ſuffer'd more than he had done, and was ſorry for his human frailty, if they could bear it better. Now, I am confident that the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will collect, that this Biſhop was never deaf to Conditions of Agreement, and that no man living could offer a greater Sacrifice than he did for a Peace-Offering, unleſs he would have ſtript himſelf of all, and not have left off his own two Mites, in all the World, to caſt into the Corban.</p>

A Serpent was taken at the River <hi>Bagrada</hi> of 120 foot long, and the skin, ſays he, was hung up in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, as long as ſuch ſtuff could endure. Mark this; a Serpent, the longeſt that ever was heard of, the skin kept when it was mortified, and preſerved in the Senate-houſe. Who can miſs to apply it? A Serpentine brood of Men; none ever laſting ſo long in that High Court: withered away to a skin, or Skeleton: all were right, if they had been hung up in the Capitol. This Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was young and the worſt it could do was to hiſs, when <hi>Lincoln</hi> was brought in to ſit with his fellow Biſhops.

Yet his chief Friends were as faithful and noble-hearted as ever ſate upon the Benches of the Houſe. And it is no good thriſt to caſt out Gold-filings with the duſt, as if all were duſt.

Though he is bound to be moſt true that is moſt truſted, yet no man was bound to be true to them, whom his Majeſty, as appears by his Writ, truſted with his moſt concerning and weighty Counſels, and were falſe to him that gave them Capacity to treat upon them.

The ſudden and quiet diſpatch of all that was done already was attributed to the Chairman's Dexterity, who could play his Prize at all Weapons, dally with crooked Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and pluck them ſtraight; bring all Stragglers into his own Pound, and never drive them in; foreſee a Tempeſt of Contradiction the beſt that ever I knew, and ſcatter it before it could riſe; and won all his Adverſaries inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, into a complyance, before they were aware.

Anatomiſts obſerve, that the thinneſt Membrane is that which covers the Brain, that no weight might ſtop it from production of Notions and Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

The Earl, a man of great Wit and Courage, knew not whether the King and all his Friends could ſave him: <hi>In a rebellious nation wrath is ſet on fire, Ecclus</hi> 16.6. And to the ſhame of Subjects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd with the new Spirit of that <hi>Bedlam</hi> rage, neither the King nor his Juſtice could protect any man.

Then the <hi>Scots</hi> were reſolved not to disband till this brave Lord was headleſs. Who hath ſeen a Hedge hog rouled up into a Ball?

So <hi>Lesſly</hi> and his Tykes were bloody and imperious, faſtned with much confidence in one body: Who could remove them? Nay, who could touch them, or go about to mollitie them, and get no harm? Then the Tumults of Sectaries, Corner-creepers, and debauch'd Hang-by's, that beſet the dutiful Lord, and Commons with Poniards and Clubbs, were worſe than an Army far off. Theſe call'd for Juſtice, that is, for the Life of the Earl.

                     </hi> Not to offend at all in great matters, is more than a man can do. Let me ſpeak of his Judges with reverence: It was a Parliament which is more able to prepare Laws to paſs where all are concern'd, than to ſit upon a Trial where one Subject is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd: Wiſe and Weak have the ſame Right to Judge; therefore <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger ſpared not to cenſure the Conſcript-Fathers of the Roman Senate, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Ep.

There were ſome in this Parliament that out of their Birth and Education were carried to noble Attempts, who would not concurr to the Ruin of great <hi>Wentworth;</hi> but their Names were poſted for it by Ruffians, as Enemies to the State: And this was never look'd into for a breach of Privilege. An Indignity will never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, till Truth hath left to breathe.

Hypocriſie dwells next door to Virtue, but never comes into its Neighbor's Houſe. What Juſtice was that which was thrown by for ever, which plaid its part ſo ill, that the very Actors hiſs'd it off the Stage, and provided by their own Vote, that it ſhould be ſeen no more? <hi>Quintil. lib.</hi> 7. hath this upon the Pleadings of his time, <hi>Tot ſaeculis nullam repertam eſſe cauſam, quae ſit tota alteriſimilis.

Sir <hi>Rob.

When they had reſolved on a way, the King would have croſt them: Diſcreet men were afraid, leſt Oppoſition ſhould make them worſe: <hi>Lincoln</hi> is conſulted, approves the King's Zeal to uſe all expedient means to reſcue his faithful Servant, but thought it would do hurt, to check what the Parliament had deviſed for a legal procedure. <hi>He that ſeeks a thing the wrong way, goes ſo far backward.</hi> In all Conteſts of Power the King is ever thought to do wrong: The King's Greatneſs, made too much contemptible already, muſt beware to take a foyl at this time: <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Mother to <hi>James</hi> the third (who was deem'd worthy the Character of <hi>Livia</hi> the Empreſs, <hi>Ulyſſes stolata, Ulyſſes</hi> in a Petticoat, <hi>Calig.</hi> in <hi>Sueton.</hi>) gave this Counfel to her Son on her Death-bed,

The firſt Queſtion which your Lordſhips have called upon me to reſolve is, <hi>Whether the Houſe of Commons may examine ſome of the Members of their Houſe before a Committee of your Lordſhips?</hi> There is no queſtion of the thing, but of the time. Regularly they ought not to do it yet: but ought firſt to put in a Specifial Charge, and the <hi>Reus,</hi> or Defendant firſt be call'd to his Anſwer. Then, and not before, Witneſſes ought to be produced. This is the regular Courſe. If the Charge be not Specifial, it may be demurred unto, and need not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd at all.

                     </gap>, particular Criminations. This is the regular way before your Witneſſes are uſed. The <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> goes a little further beſide the Rule: For in the King's Cauſe, upon Affidavit of Sickneſs, to prevent Mortality, and as it were <hi>de benè eſſe,</hi> ſome Witneſſes have been admitted to Examination before any Anſwer put in, or Iſſue joyned. Though theſe Witneſſes were to be re-examin'd after Iſſue joyn'd, in caſe they recover'd. A particular Charge being laid before you, when the Houſe of Commons is a Party, and the Charge of ſo high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as Treaſon, I ſhall not adviſe this Honourable Houſe to uſe any Chiquance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Pettiſoggery with this great Repreſentation of the Kingdom; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them forthwith to examine their own Members; yet with this Caution, To hew the Names two days before they be produced, to the Sollicitor of the Defendant, that he may have notice of the perſons. But the Houſe preſs for Secrecy in the Examination. Well, they are ſafe enough while they are in the Lord's hands; who have <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> perfect Knowledge, and perfect Integrity: and therefore nothing can be ſuſpected. Are not they ſurer than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers? In ordinary Commiſſions out of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> my Lord <hi>Ellſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> would not allow that any Clerks ſhould be uſed, to prevent Futility and Evaporation, ſaying, <hi>That the beſt Commiſſioner in</hi> England <hi>was not too good to be the King's Clerk.</hi> Secondly, I am as'kt about the Examination of the Peers, and the Aſſiſtants of this Houſe upon Oath. There is no queſtion to be made about the Aſſiſtants, they are no Peers of this Kingdom; but whether Peers may be produced as Witneſſes, and teſtifie upon Oath? A queſtion not ſit to be now handled, and impoſſible to be reſolved out of the Rolls of the Parliament; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Peers give their Teſtimony both in this Court, and others, either way. And I am confident a Peers Averment againſt his Fellow Peer cannot be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either way; eſpecially in caſe of Treaſon: For a Peer judgeth his Peer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Death upon his Honour, and therefore may witneſs againſt him upon his Honour. In this Court, and almoſt in this Caſe, in <hi>Alze Pierce</hi> her Caſe, 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Num.</hi> 21. Lord <hi>Roger Beauchamp</hi> ſwears upon the Holy Evangeliſts: The Lord of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> is examin'd, but not ſworn. Nay, both ways have been declar'd in this Houſe to be all one. Your Lordſhips declaring that you did not bound, limit, or terminate your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion with your Honour, but mount it, and relate it up unto God, that gave you your Honour; and yielded your ſelves perjur'd, if you falſiſied in ſwearing upon Honour; which is juſt the very ſame, as if you ſware upon the Holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts. To ſwear upon Honour, and reſt there, were Idolatry. But to ſwear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Honour with a Report and Relation to God, who beſtowed it upon your Lordſhips, as a ſpecial Favour and Grace, is as Chriſtian an Oath as any in the World: For new Scruples in the manner, as to touch the Book, to look on the Book, to hold up a Finger or Hand to Heaven, are Ceremonies which the Houſe of Commons little regards, but leaves them to us: And the Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> is ſo wiſe, that he will never queſtion the Honour of his Peers. And why ſhould we trouble our ſelves about the circumſtance, but leave each Lord called to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to call God as a Witneſs to his Aſſertion, in which of theſe two manners it ſhall pleaſe his Lordſhip: Not the Book, not the Honour, but the Invocation of God to bear witneſs to the Aſſertion, makes the Oath.</p>

144. I am put to it by your Lordſhips, to ſpeak, in the third place, about the examination of Privy Councillors: Here needs no diſtinction between Peers and Aſſiſtants: This is part of a Privy Councillor's Oath, <hi>That he ſhall keep ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret all matters committed and revealed to him, or that ſhall be treated of in Council.</hi> 2. <hi>If any Treaty touch his fellow-Councillor, he ſhall not reveal it unto him, till the King or Council ſhall require it.</hi> I collect now, that matters of Fact he may reveal without violation of his Oath; and that he may be examin'd of matters revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto him, that were treated of in Council, if they were not treated of in Council when he was preſent: That a Privy-Councillor, for all his Oath, may be examin'd concerning Words, Advices, or Opinions of another Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillor, otherwiſe given than in Council: That Bed-chamber and Gallery Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is nothing to the Council-Table: Private Entertainers of the King, when the Counſellors attend at the Door, are not to paſs for Counſellors: Ear-wiggs and Whiſperers are no Counſellors, but detracters from Counſellors: If they adviſe the Deſtruction of the King, the State, or the Laws of the Realm there is nothing in the Oath to protect ſuch an Ear-worm, but he may be appeached: For matters which touch another fellow-Councillor, or matters committed otherwiſe to him, or which ſhall be treated of in Council, theſe are not to be concealed from all forts of men, but from private men only; not from the King, not from the Council, (both thoſe are in the Oath) nor from the Parliament: That Privy-Councillots may be examin'd by Command of the Parliament, for things treated in Council; 2. for things revealed unto them ſecretly, from the King in his Bed-chamber; 3. and eſpecially, for ear-wigging and treating with the King in private, after things already ſettled in Council. The Caſe of <hi>Alze Pierce,</hi> 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. <hi>num.</hi> 41. clears all theſe Doubts: And it is the Caſe alſo of a Deputy of <hi>Ireland. William of Windſor,</hi> Lord-Deputy, misbehaved himſelf in <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Council directs Sir <hi>Nicholas Dagworth</hi> to go thither, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into his Actions; <hi>Windſor</hi> makes means to <hi>Alze Pierce</hi> to keep off this man, under pretence of Enmity betwixt them: This <hi>Shunamite,</hi> that lay in <hi>David's</hi> Boſom, prevails with the King to ſtay Sir <hi>N. Dagworth,</hi> the Council-Order not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding: The Lords in Parliament queſtion her for this act, as having drawn with it the Ruin of the State in <hi>Ireland:</hi> She pleads not guilty, Iſſue is joyned: The Lords produce <hi>inter alios, John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> upon his Honor, and <hi>Roger Beauchamp</hi> Lord Chamberlain, upon the Evangeliſts: <hi>Alze</hi> produceth of her part the Steward and Comptroller of the Houſhold: All theſe four were Privy-Counſellors; they depoſe all of them nothing elſe but matters trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in Council, and oppoſed by <hi>Alze Pierce,</hi> treating with the King out of Council. So that, if this Record be true, this Caſe is cleared, Privy-Councillors may not be forced by ordinary Courts of Juſtice, to reveal things treated of in Council, but may be produced, upon Oath and Honour, to reveal ſuch Secrets by the King, the Council, or the Parliament, eſpecially in deteſtation of State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiſperers and Ear-wiggs; yea, though they had taken no Oath at all. Yet God forbid a Privy-Counſellor ſhould witneſs againſt his Fellow, for publickly venting the freedom of his Judgment at the Board, who is bound to adviſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, not wiſely; as I do here this day. Should any man be accuſed for an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Judgment? O God defend! peradventure my Error hath ſet all the reſt of the Council ſtraight: <hi>Errores antiquorum venerari oportet: ſi illi non erraſſent, minùs ipſe providiſſem:</hi> otherwiſe you would take away all Freedom of Debates, nay, almoſt of very Thoughts. If I knew any man would witneſs againſt me for my Council-Table Opinion, I would ſay to him as <hi>Gallus</hi> did to <hi>Tyberius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, Good Sir, ſpeak you firſt, for I may miſtake, and you may witneſs againſt me for it in the next Parliament.</hi> Some did make Laws with Ropes about their Necks: What? Muſt men give their Counſel as it were with Ropes about their Necks? <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>When thou comeſt to a rich man's table, put a knife to thy Throat.</hi> But what's here? When we give Judgment, as we are able, among the Lords of the Council, muſt we put an Ax to our Necks? Beware of ſuch Traps, pittying the caſe of human Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p n="145">145. The fourth Queſtion is thus comprized; <hi>Whether ſome Members of the Houſe of Commons may be preſent at the Examination.</hi> Judicially they cannot, the Judicature is in your Lordſhips; but whether organically and miniſterially, is the Scruple to be ſatisfied. I will be brief in my Conceptions, what is againſt the claim of the Houſe of Commons, and what is for them. This is not for them, That 50 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. one <hi>Love</hi> was a Witneſs in Lord <hi>John Nevile</hi>'s Caſe;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49492:195"/>
                     <hi>Love</hi> denied what he had confeſt before two Knights, Members of the Lower Houſe: The Houſe of Commons ſend them to the Lords to confront <hi>Love;</hi> which they did, and <hi>Love</hi> was thereupon committed. Now, their being here was only to confront, not to aſſiſt the Lords, either judicially or miniſterially. Many things make for them, why they may be there, miniſterially at leaſt: Firſt, Originally both Houſes were together, and ſo the Commons heard all Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; <hi>Conſiderent inter ſe. Modus ten. Pl.</hi> and ſate ſo till <hi>Anno</hi> 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. by Mr. <hi>Elſing</hi>'s Collections, which are not over-authentick. Secondly, After that time, they have, all the Houſe of Commons, been preſent, when Witneſſes were ſworn here—<hi>Anno</hi> 5 <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. <hi>Rot.</hi> 11. ſwears his Fealty before the Lords and Commons; and two or three days after, by the ſame Oath, and before the ſame perſons, clears the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from a Suſpicion of Treaſon laid to their charge. The Commons were by, and heard all this. The third Reaſon is, Mr. Attorny-General, if this Lord were arraigned of Treaſon (as I pray God bleſs him from deſerving it) would be by, and obſerve his Defence, and ſuch Witneſſes as he ſhould produce for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and would, no doubt, bring Counter proofs <hi>Sur le Champ,</hi> and upon the ſudden againſt the ſame, if he were able. The Houſe of Commons is in this caſe the King's Attorny, who make and maintain the charge. So far, out of brief Notes (for take them to be no other) you have a ſtrong Judgment paſs'd upon four Queſtions. Says <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Brutus,</hi> of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Eloquence, <hi>Tabulam benè pictam collocat in bono lumine; He draws his Picture well, and hangs it out to be well ſeen:</hi> So here's a Piece well drawn, and placed in the light of Perſpicuity. His next Argument is very long, but of that uſe to the Reader, that he ſhall not ſind ſo much Learning in any Author on that Theme, that I know a Scholar would not want it. They that foſtered deadly Enmities againſt E. <hi>Strafford,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to remove the Biſhops from the hearing of his Cauſe. This Biſhop and his Brethren minding to him all the Pity and Help they could ſhew him, the Oppoſites began to vote them out of Doors, and would not admit them in the Right of Peers in this Cauſe, becauſe it was upon Life and Blood, <hi>Lincoln</hi> maintains, that the Lords did them Injury, and that Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> may, and ought to vote in <hi>causâ ſanguinis,</hi> That they were never inhibited by the Law of this Land, never by the Peers of the Land before this time; That their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary forbearance in ſome Centuries of the Ages before, proceeded from their Fears of the Canons of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the ſpecial Leave of the King and both Houſes, who were graciouſly pleaſed to allow of their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations for their Indemnity, as Church-men, when the King and Parliament might have rejected their Proteſtations, if they had pleas'd. And much he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon it, that the opponent Lords grounded their Judgment upon the corrupt Canons of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Indeed, I find in my own Papers, that the Monks of <hi>Canterbury</hi> complain'd againſt <hi>Hubert</hi> their Archbiſhop, to the Pope, for ſitting upon Tryals of Life and Blood: They could not complain, that he went againſt the Laws and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> but their Appeal was to the Pope's Juſtice; and it was more tolerable for Monks to rake in the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh of the Roman Courts, than for Engliſh Barons. And ſay, in ſooth, muſt not Divines of the Reformed Church meddle in Cauſe of Blood? <gap reason="foreign">

And ſo for <hi>Edg-hill</hi> and <hi>Newberry, &amp;c.</hi> Could they ruſh into ſo many Fights, and be clear from cauſe of Blood? Nay, the Pontiſical part make but a Mockery of this Canon; for <hi>anno</hi> 1633, a Book was printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſill'd with a Catalogue of Cardinals, Biſhops, and Prieſts, who had been brave Warriours, moſt of them Leaders in the Field; the Author, a Sycophant, aimed to pleaſe Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and a Fig for the Canons: Reaſon, Canons, Parliamentary Privileges, nay Religion, are to corrupt men, as they like them for their own ends.

And thus it continued in this Kingdom long after the Conqueſt, to wit, in <hi>Henry Beu-clerk</hi>'s time, after whoſe Reign it began to be a little limited and reſtrained; for at <hi>Clarendon, anno</hi> 1164, 8 <hi>Calend. Febr.</hi> 11 <hi>Henr.</hi> 21, a general Record is agreed upon by that King's Special Command, of all the Cuſtoms and Liberties of this Kingdom, ever ſince <hi>Hen.</hi> the Firſt, the King's Grandfather; as you may ſee in <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> p. 96, of the firſt Edition; where, among other Cuſtoms agreed upon, this is one: <hi>Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and all other perſons of this Kingdom, which hold of the King</hi> in capite, <hi>are to enjoy their Poſſeſſions of the King as a Barony, and by reaſon thereof, are to anſwer before the Judges and Officers of the King, and to obſerve and perform all the King's Cuſtoms: And juſt as the reſt of the Barons ought (for it was a Duty required of them, as the King now by his Summons doth from us) to be preſent in the Judgments of the King's Courts, together with the reſt of the Barons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch time as they ſhall there proceed to the mangling of Members, or Sentence of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="147">147. Obſerve, that there is a diverſity of reading in the laſt words; for <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> a young Monk, that lived long after, reads this Cuſtom thus; <hi>Quouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que perveniatur ad diminutionem membrorum, vel ad mortem.</hi> Which may be wreſted to the firſt agitation of any Charge tending that way; but <hi>Quadrilogus,</hi> a Book written in that very Age, and the original Copy of the Articles of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> which <hi>Becket</hi> ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> extant at this day in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, and out of which <hi>Baronius,</hi> in his Annals, <hi>anno</hi> 1164, tranſcribes it, reads the Cuſtom thus, <hi>Uſque perveniatur in judicio ad diminutionem membrorum, &amp;c.</hi> which leaves the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to ſit there, until the Judgment come to be pronounced, amounting to Death, or Mutilation of Members. And as this was agreed to be the Cuſtom, ſo was it the Practice alſo, after that 11th year, to wit, in the 15th year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, at what time the Lay-Peers are ſo far from requiring the Biſhops to withdraw, that they endeavour to force them alone to hear and determine a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49492:196"/>matter of Treaſon in the perſon of <hi>Becket. Stephanides</hi> is my Author for this, who was a Chaplain and Follower of that Archbiſhop, <hi>The Barons ſay,</hi> ſaith that Author, <hi>You Biſhops ought to pronounce Sentence upon your ſelves; we are Laicks, you are Church-men, as</hi> Becket <hi>is; you are his fellow-Prieſts, and fellow-Biſhops.</hi> To whom ſome one of the Biſhops replied, <hi>This belongs to you, my Lords, rather than to us, for this is no eccleſiaſtical, but a ſecular Judicature: We ſit not here as Biſhops, but as Barons. Nos Barones, &amp; vos Barones, hic Pares ſumus.</hi> And in vain it is that you ſhould labour to find any difference at all in our Order or Calling. See this Manuſcript cited by Mr. <hi>Selden, Titles of Honour,</hi> 2 Edit. <hi>p.</hi> 705. And thus the Cuſtom continued till the <hi>21ſt</hi> year of the ſame King <hi>Henry</hi> II. at what time that Provincial Synod was kept at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and ſome few of his Suffragans, which <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> mentions in his Hiſtory, <hi>p.</hi> 543. And it ſeems <hi>Gervaſius Dorobernenſis,</hi> which is a Manuſcript I have not ſeen. The quoting of this Monk in the Margin of that Collection of Privileges, which Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> by command, had made for the Upper Houſe of Parliament, is the only ground of ſtirring up this Queſtion againſt the Biſhops at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, intended by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> for a Privilege to the Biſhops, not for a Privilege to the Lay Peers, to be preſſed againſt the Biſhops. The Canon runs thus: <hi>It is not lawful for ſuch as are conſtituted in Holy Orders,</hi> Judicium ſanguinis agitare, <hi>to put in execution Judgment of Blood; and therefore we forbid, that they ſhall either in their own perſons execute any ſuch mutilation of Members, or ſentence them to be ſo acted by others: And if any ſuch perſon ſhall do any ſuch thing, he ſhall be deprived of the Office and Place of his Order and Function. We do likewiſe ſorbid, under the peril of Excommunication, that no Prieſt be a ſecular Sheriff or Provoſt.</hi> Now this is no Canon made in <hi>England,</hi> much leſs confirmed by Common Law, or aſſented to by all the Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or by any one of the Province of <hi>York,</hi> but tranſcribed (as appears by <hi>Hovenden</hi>'s Margin) out of a Council of <hi>Toledo;</hi> which in the time that Council is ſuppoſed to be held, was the leaſt Kingdom in <hi>Spain,</hi> and not ſo big as <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and conſequently improper to regulate all the World, and eſpecially this remote Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> Beſide, as this poor Monk ſets it down, it doth inhibit Church-men from being Hang-men, rather than from being Judges, to condemn men to be thus mutilated and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in their Members, an ordinary Puniſhment of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> who then lived in <hi>Spain,</hi> but never heard of here with us of many years before the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> II, and therefore not ſitly preſſed to drive Biſhops from ſitting as Peers in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who is not to be ſentenc'd to any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation of Members. True it is, that in the Council it ſelf, being the Eleventh Council of <hi>Toledo, Can.</hi> 6. they are forbidden, <hi>Quod morte plectendum ſit ſententiâ propria judicare,</hi> to ſentence in any Cauſe that is to be puniſh'd with Death: Whereas, in the Fourth Council of <hi>Toledo, Can.</hi> 31, under <hi>Siſinandus,</hi> not long before, held <hi>anno</hi> 633, it is ſaid, That the Kings do oftentimes commit to Prieſts and Biſhops their Judicature, <hi>Contra quoſcunque Majeſtatis obnoxios,</hi> againſt all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; howbeit they are directed not to obey their King in this particular, unleſs they have him bound by Oath to pardon the Party, in caſe they ſhall find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to mediate for him. And thus the Canon-Law went in <hi>Spain,</hi> but no where elſe in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in that Age.</p>
                  <p n="148">148. But theſe Biſhops at <hi>Weſtm.</hi> travelled not ſo far as <hi>Toledo,</hi> to fetch in this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non into their Synod, but took it out of <hi>Gratian,</hi> then in vogue, (for he lived in the time of <hi>Hen. Beu-clerk,</hi> Grandfather to this <hi>Hen.</hi> II.) who in the ſecond part of his Decrees, <hi>Cap. de Clericis,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Clericis in ſacris ordinibus conſtitutis ex con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Tolet. Judicium ſanguinis agitaro non licet.</hi> And ſo this Canon was fetch'd from <hi>Spain</hi> into theſe other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> above four hundred years after the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, upon this occaſion. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, otherwiſe called <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> having ſo many deadly Quarrels againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> to make his part good and ſtrong, laid the firſt ground (which his Succeſſors in their Canons cloſely purſued) to draw the Biſhops, and other great Prelates of <hi>Germany, France, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> from their Lay-Soveraigns and Leige-Lords, to depend wholly upon him, and ſo by colour and pretence of Eccleſiaſtical Immunities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew them from the Services of their Princes, in War and in Peace, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly from exerciſing all Places of Judicature in the Civil Courts of Princes, to the which Offices they were by their Breeding and Education more enabled, than the martial Lay-Lords of that rough Age, and by their Fiefs and Baronies, which they held from Kings and Emperors, particularly bound and obliged. And
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49492:197"/>therefore you ſhall find, that whereas the Biſhops of this Iſland before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, did ſtill joyn with the Thanes, Aldermen, and Lay-Lords, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and executing of all Laws whatſoever, touching deprivation of Life, and mutilation of Members: Yet ſoon after, when the <hi>Norman</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <hi>Lanfrank, Anſelm, Becket,</hi> and the reſt, began to trade with <hi>Rome,</hi> and as <hi>Legati nati,</hi> to wed the Laws and Canons cried up in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to plant them here in <hi>England,</hi> they withdrew by little and little our Prelates from theſe Employments, and Dependencies upon the Kings of <hi>England;</hi> and, under the colour of Exemptions and Church-Immunities, erected in this Land an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Eſtate and Monarchy, depending wholly upon the Pope, inhibiting them to exerciſe ſecular Employments, or to ſit with the reſt of the Peers in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures of Life and Members, otherwiſe than as they liſt themſelves; and hence principally did ariſe thoſe great heats between our <hi>Rufus</hi> and <hi>Anſelm,</hi> which <hi>Eadmer</hi> ſpeaks of, and thoſe ancient Cuſtoms of this Kingdom, which <hi>Hen.</hi> II. preſſed upon <hi>Becket,</hi> in the Articles of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates ought to be preſent in the King's Courts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> a notable <hi>Boutefeu</hi> of thoſe times in the Church of God, did tolerate, though not approve of; as he apoſtyles that Article with his own Hand, to be ſhewn to this day in the M. S. extant in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library. And although I ſhall not deny, but the Popes did plead Scripture for this Inhibition (as they did for all things elſe) and allude unto that place, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. which they backed with one of the Canons of the Apoſtles, as they call them, the ſeventh in number. Yet it is clear, their main Authority is fetch'd from this obſcure Synod of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where eighteen Biſhops only were convened, under <hi>Bamba</hi> the <hi>Goth,</hi> who of a Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was made a King, and of a King a Cloyſter'd Monk; as you may ſee in the Hiſtory of <hi>Rodericus Santius, par.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 32. This is all the goodly Ground that either <hi>Gratian</hi> in his Decrees, or <hi>Innocent</hi> III, in the Decretals, or <hi>Roger Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veden</hi> in his Hiſtory, alledges againſt the Eccleſiaſtical Peers, their ſitting as Judges in Cauſes of Blood, to wit, this famous <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Council of <hi>Toledo.</hi> The firſt that planted this Canon here in <hi>England</hi> was <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> a Cardinal, the Pope's Creature, (as his Holineſs was pleaſed to ſtile him in his Bull) and thruſt upon the See of <hi>Canterbury</hi> by a Papal Proviſion, where he continued in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt his Soveraign, as long as King <hi>John</hi> lived. This Archbiſhop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of Eccleſiaſtical Immunity (for ſo this Canon is marſhall'd by <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>) at <hi>Oſney</hi> near <hi>Oxford,</hi> did ordain; <hi>Ne quis Clericus beneficiatus, vol in ſacris Ordinibus conſtitutus praeſumat intereſſe, ubi judicium ſanguinis tractatur, vel exercea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> And this is the firſt Canon broach'd in this Kingdom to this effect; that of <hi>Othobone</hi> being ſubſequent in time, and a meer Foreign or Legantine Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution: See it at large in <hi>Linwood, Conſtit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ad ſinem.</hi> And by vertue of a Branch of this very Conſtitution, the now Archbiſhop, two years ſince, ſined the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> in the High-Commiſſion, becauſe he had given way, in time of Peſtilence only, that a Seſſions, a Judgment of Blood, might be kept in a ſacred place, which was likewiſe inhibited in this Canon. But this admits of a multitude of Anſwers. Firſt,</p>

And <hi>Othobon</hi> himſelf, inhibiting other Clerks to uſe theſe Secular Judicatures, hath a <hi>Salvo</hi> to preſerve the Priviledges of our Lord the King, whereby he may uſe any of their Services in that kind, when he ſhall ſee cauſe, <hi>Tit. ne Clerici Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſ. ſaec. exerceant.</hi> And <hi>Linwood</hi> upon that Text, doth inſtance in the Clerks of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> and others.

Thirdly, When they are forbidden, <hi>intereſſe,</hi> to be preſent, the meaning is not (in the very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons themſelves, that they ſhould go out of the room; but only that they ſhould not be preſent to add Authority, Help, and Advice to any Sentence pronounced againſt a particular or individual Perſon in cauſe of Blood, or mutilation.

Doctor. Vol.</hi> 10. <hi>p.</hi> 121. Fourthly, Theſe Canons are not in force in <hi>England,</hi> to bind the King's Subjects, for ſeveral Reaſons: Firſt, Becauſe they are againſt his Majeſty's Prerogative, as you may ſee it clearly in the Articles of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and the Writ of Summons, and therefore aboliſhed 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8. It is his Majeſty's Prerogative, declar'd at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> that all ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Peers, as hold of him by Barony, ſhould aſſiſt in the King's Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, until the very actual pronouncing of a Sentence of Blood. And this holds from <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt down to the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgiſt</hi> as a Commiſſioner upon the Life of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to keep him in Cuſtody, and to examine him after that Commotion in <hi>London.</hi> And to ſay that this Canon is confirm'd by Common Law, is a merry Tale; there being nothing in the Common Law that tends that way. Secondly, It hath been voted in the Houſe of Commons, in this very Seſſion of Parliament, <hi>That no Canons ſince the Conqueſt, either introduced from</hi> Rome <hi>by Legatine Power, or made in our Synods, had in any Age, nor yet have at this preſent, any power to bind the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Realm, unleſs they be confirmed by Act of Parliament.</hi> Now theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which inhibit the Preſence of Church-men in Cauſe that concerns Life and Member, were never confirm'd by any, but ſeem to be impeach't by divers and ſundry Acts of Parliament. Thirdly, The whole Houſe of Peers have this very Seſſion deſpiſed and ſet aſide this Canon Law, which ſome of the young Lords cry up again in the ſame Seſſion, and in the very ſame Cauſe, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Votes of the Biſhops, in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford.</hi> For by the ſame Canon Law that forbids Clergy-men to Sentence, they of that Coat are more ſtrictly inhibited to give no Teſtimony in Cauſes of Blood. <hi>Nee ettam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt eſſe teſt is vel tabellio in causâ Sanguinis.</hi> Linw. part 2. ſol. 146.

Biſhops, it ſeems, may be Witneſſes, to kill ont-right; but may not ſit in the Diſcuſſion of the Cauſe, to help, in caſe of Innocency, a diſtreſſed Nobleman. Whereas the very <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Biſhops, who firſt invented this Excluſion of Prelates from ſuch Judicatures, allow them to Vote, as long as there is any hope left of clearing the Party, or gaining of Pardon. 4. <hi>Conc.

                  <p n="150">150. The only Objection which appears upon any Learning or Record, againſt the Clergies Voting in this Kingdom in Cauſes of Blood, are two or three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, entred by the Biſhops among the Records of the upper Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and ſome few Paſſages in the Law-Books relating thereunto. The Proteſtation the Lords now principally ſtand upon, is that of <hi>William Courtney</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. inſerted in the Book of Priviledges, which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> collected for the Lords of the upper Houſe. In the Margin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49492:198"/>that paſſage out of <hi>R. Hovenden,</hi> about which we ſpake before about Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-mens agitation of Judgments of Blood, is unluckily inſerted, and for want of due conſideration, and ſome ſuſpicion of partial carriage in the Biſhops, in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> hath been eagerly preſſed upon the Biſhops by ſome of the Lords, in ſuch an unuſual and unaccuſtomed manner, that if I my ſelf, offering to ſpeak to this Objection, had not voluntarily withdrawn, the reſt of the Biſhops and I had been, without hearing, voted out of the Houſe, in the agitation of a Splinter of that Cauſe of the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s, which came not near any matter of Blood. An act never done before in that honourable Houſe, and ready to be executed ſuddenly, without the leaſt conſideration of the merit of the Cauſe. The only words inſiſted upon in the Proteſtation of <hi>Courtney</hi>'s, are theſe; <hi>Becauſe in this preſent Parliament certain matters are agitated, whereat it is not lawſul for us, according to the Preſcript of holy Canons, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi>—And by and by after they ſay—<hi>Theſe matters are ſuch, in the which,</hi> Nec poſſumus, nec debemus intereſſe—This is the Proteſtation moſt ſtood upon. That of Archbiſhop <hi>Arundel</hi> 21 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. is not ſo full and ample as this of <hi>Courtney</hi>'s: For the Biſhops going forth left their Proxies with the Lay-Lords, and conſequently continued preſent in Judicature in the eye and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Law. Therefore I apply my Anſwers to <hi>Courtney</hi>'s Proteſtation principally; which are divers, and fit to be weighed and ponder'd. Firſt, I do obſerve that Biſhops did never proteſt or withdraw in Cauſes of Blood, but only under the unſteddy Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. Never before, nor after the time of that unfortunate King, to this preſent Parliament, for ought appears in Record or Hiſtory. And that one <hi>Swallow</hi> ſhould make us ſuch a Spring, and one Omiſſion ſhould create a Law or Cuſtom againſt ſo many Actions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates, under ſo many Kings before, ſo many Kings and Queens after that young Prince, ſeems to me a ſtrange Doctrine; eſpecially when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that by the Rules of the Civil and Common Law, a Proteſtation dies with the death of him that makes it, or is regularly vacated and diſannulled, <hi>Per con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarium actum ſubſequentem proteſtationem,</hi> by any one ſubſequent act varying from the tenour of the ſaid Proteſtation. <hi>Regul.

Now that you may know how the Prelates carried themſelves in this point, and actually voted in Cauſes of Treaſon, and ſometimes to Blood, before <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I refer me to what I cited before out of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and he out of <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi> concerning <hi>Becket</hi> condemned by his Peers Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal, 15 <hi>H.</hi> 2.

Secondly, It is fitting we know the nature of a Proteſtation, which ſome may miſtake: <hi>Proteſtatio eſt animi noſtri declaratio, juris acquirendi, vel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervandi, vel damnum depellendi causâ facta,</hi> ſaith <hi>Spiegle, Calvin,</hi> and all the <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> No Proteſtation is made by any man in his Wits, to deſtroy his own Right, and much leſs another mans, but to acquire, or preſerve ſome Right, or to avoid and put off ſome Wrong, that was like to happen to the Party or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49492:198"/>that make the Proteſtation: As here in <hi>Courtney</hi>'s Proteſtation, the Prelates in the firſt place conceive a Right and Power they had voluntarily to abſent themſelves, while ſome matters were treated of at that time in the Houſe of Lords, which by the Canon-Law (the Breach whereof the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> did vindicate in thoſe times, with far more Severity than they did the Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Law of God) they were not ſuffer'd to be preſent at, not for want of Right to be there in all Cauſes, but for fear of Papal Cenſures. In the next place, they did preſerve their former Right as Peers, which they ſtill had, (though voluntarily abſenting themſelves) <hi>More ſolito intereſſendi, conſiderandi, tyactandi, ordinandi, &amp; definiendi,</hi> all things without exception acted and executed in that Parliament. And, in the laſt place, they proteſt againſt any loſs of right of being or voting in Parliament, that could befall them, for this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary abſenting of themſelves at this time. And where in all this Proteſtation is there one word to prejudice their Succeſſors, or to authorize any Peer to command his fellow-Peer, called thither by the ſame Writ of Summons that himſelf is, and by more ancient Preſcription, to withdraw and go out from this Common-Council of the Kingdom? Thirdly, We do not certainly know what theſe matters were whereat Archbiſhop <hi>Courtney</hi> conceived the Prelates neither could nor ought to be preſent: Theſe matters are left in looſe and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral words in that Proteſtation. Some conceive indeed it was at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Treſſilian, Brambre,</hi> L. <hi>Beauchamp,</hi> and others, <hi>Ant. Brit. p.</hi> 286. But the Notes of Privileges belonging to the Lords, collected by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> do, with more reaſon a great deal, aſſign this going forth of the Prelates, to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by certain Appeals of Treaſon, preferred in that Parliament by the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> whom the Popiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of thoſe Times (as you know) exempted, as a ſacred perſon, from the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of King or Parliament; and therefore the reſt of the Biſhops, as the Squares went then, neither could nor ought to be preſent, and Parties, to break the Exemptions, Immunities, and Privileges of that great Prelate. But the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> is not the Archbiſhop, but the Preſident of <hi>York;</hi> and to challenge any ſuch Exemptions and Immunities at this time, from the cognizance of King and Parliament, amounts to little leſs than Treaſon: Therefore this Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is very unſeaſonably urged, to thruſt out any Proteſtant Prelate from voting in Parliament. Laſtly, In the Civil and Canon-Law, (for the Law of this Land knoweth it not) a Proteſtation is but a Teſtation or witneſſing before-hand of a man's own Mind or Opinion, whereby they that proteſt, provide to ſave and preſorve their own Right, for the time to come. It concludes no more bende themſelves, no Stranger to the Act, no Succeſſor; but, if it be admitted, ſticks as inherent in the ſingular and individual perſon, until either the Party dyes or the Proteſtation be drawn and revoked. Therefore, what is a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation made by <hi>Will. Courtney</hi> to <hi>Will. Laud?</hi> Or by <hi>Tho. Arundel</hi> to bind <hi>Tho. Morton?</hi> And, what one Rule in the Common-Law of the Land, in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes by the great Favour of the King, Lords, and Commons, (not otherwiſe) they were permitted to abſent themſelves, never before now commanded by the Lay-Lords to forbear their Votes in any Cauſe that was agitated in Parliament: So our Law Books ſay, <hi>That the Prelates, by the Canon-Law, may make a Procurator in Parliament, when a Peer is to be tryed:</hi> Which is enough to ſhew their Right thereunto.

Coming now to an end, it moves me little what ſome object, <hi>That many worthy Fathers of this Church-reformed, and Biſhop</hi> Andrews <hi>among the reſt, did forbear to vote in Cauſes of Blood, and voluntarily retired out of the Houſe, if ſuch things came in queſtion; nor did offer to enter any Proteſtation.</hi> I do not doubt, but they had pious Affections in it, though they did not fully ponder what they did: I have heard, that a main Reaſon was that of the Record and Statute of 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. <hi>That it is the honeſty of that Calling not to intermeddle in matters of Blood.</hi> Now the French word <hi>Honeſty</hi> ſignifies Decency and Comelineſs: As though it were a butcherly and a loathſom matter to be a Judge, or to do Right upon a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, to Death, or loſs of Members: But this is an imaginary Decency, never
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49492:199"/>known in Nature or Scripture, (as I ſaid before) but begotten by Tradition in the dark Foggs and Miſts of Popery: Such an Honeſty of the Clergy it was to have a ſhaven Crown, to depend on the Pope, to plead Exemptions, and to reſuſe to anſwer for Felonies in the King's Courts. All theſe were eſteemed in thoſe days the Honeſty of the Clergy: And ſuch an Honeſty it was in the Prelates of <hi>England,</hi> in the looſe Reign of <hi>Rich.</hi> II, to abſent themſelves when they liſted from the Aſlembly of the Eſtate, contrary to the King's Command in the Writ of Summons, and to the Duties of their places as Peers of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Yet they had more inſight into what they did, than ſome of our Biſhops; for they never offer'd to retire themſelves in thoſe days, before their Proteſtation was benignly received, and ſuffer'd to be enter'd upon the Parliament-Roll, by the King, the Lords, and the Houſe of Commons. I know thoſe excellent men, that are with God, propoſed other Scruples to themſelves; they doubted not of the Legality or Comelineſs, for an Eccleſiaſtical Peer of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to vote in a Judgment of Blood; they did it continually in paſſing all Appeals and Attainders in Parliament; but it ſtartled them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the practice of Prelates in other parts of the Chriſtian Church ſo to do, and thought it better to avoid Scandal, and the Talk of other Nations. That there being in the High Court of Parliament, and <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> Judges enough beſide them, they might, without any prejudice to their King and Country, forbear voting in thoſe Judicatures; ſomewhat the rather, becauſe all our Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> are Divines, and Preachers of the Goſpel, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be employ'd in Mercy, rather than in Judgment; who never touch upon the ſharpneſs of the Law, unleſs it be to prepare mens Hearts to reliſh and receive the comfort of the Goſpel. Let the Piety then, and the Good-meaning of thoſe grave Fathers be praiſed; but I ſay, they forgot their Duty to the Writ of the King's Summons, and the uſe and weight of their Place. And now, to cloſe. I proteſt, without vaunting, I cannot perceive how this can be anſwer'd, which I have digeſted together: And if ſo many Biſhops cannot obtain their Right, which is ſo clear on their ſide, God ſend the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> better Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, who is but a ſingle Peer.</p>

Laſtly, If I were ſecretly invited to move His Majeſty to adviſe upon the paſſing of this Bill, yet ſpeaking mine own Heart and Sence, and not binding any of my Brethren in this Opinion, if I found the major part of this Houſe to paſs this Bill, without much qualification, I ſhould never have the boldneſs, nor deſire to ſit any more in any judicial place in this moſt honourable Houſe. And therefore, my H. Lordſhips, here I have ſixt my <hi>Areopagus,</hi> and dernier Reſort, being not like to make any further Appeal; which makes me humbly deſire your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, to ſpeak for ſome longer time than I have accuſtomed in a Committee; in which length, notwithſtanding, I hope to uſe a great deal of brevity, ſome length in the whole, and much ſhortneſs in every particular Head, which I mean ſo to diſtinguiſh, and beat out, that not only your Lordſhips, but the Lords my Brethren may enlarge themſelves upon all the particulars, which neither my Abilities of Body can perform, nor doth my Intention nor Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe aim at, at this time: I will therefore caſt this whole Bill into ſix ſeveral Heads, wherein I hope to comprehend all that I ſhall ſay, or any man elſe can materially touch upon in this Bill. The firſt is, the Riſe or Motive of this Bill, which is the Duty of men in Holy Orders, for the words are, <hi>Perſons in Holy Orders ought not to intermeddle, &amp;c.</hi> And this Duty of Miniſters may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this place two ſeveral ways; either for their Duty in point of Divinity, or for their Duty in point of Convenience, which we commonly call Policy. In regard of either of theſe Duties it may be conceived, that men in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ought not to intermeddle in Sacred Affairs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is the Motive, Riſe, and Ground of this Bill. The ſecond point are the perſons concerned in the Bill, which are Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Parſons, Vicars, and all other in Holy Orders. The third point contains the things inhibited from this time forward, to ſuch perſons by this Bill, and they are of ſeveral ſorts and natures: Firſt, Freeholds and Rights of ſuch perſons, as their Suffrages, Votes, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power in Parliament: Secondly, Matters of Princely Favours; as to ſit in <hi>Star-chamber,</hi> to be call'd to the Council-board, to be Juſtices of the Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, Matters of a mixt and concrete nature, that ſeem to be both Freeholds and Favours of former Princes; as, the Charters of ſome of the Biſhops, and ſome of the ancient Cathedrals, are conceived to be: And theſe are all the matters or things inhibited from thoſe perſons in Holy Orders, by this preſent Bill. The fourth point is the manner of this Inhibition, which is of a double nature; firſt, of a ſevere Penalty; and ſecondly, under <hi>Cain</hi>'s Mark, an eternalkind of Diſability and Incapacity laid upon them, from enjoying hereafter any of thoſe Freeholds, Rights, Favours, or Charters of former Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that which is the heavieſt point of all, without killing of <hi>Abel,</hi> or any Crime laid to their Charge, more than that in the beginning of the Bill it is ſaid roundly, and in the ſtyle of <hi>Lacedaemon, That they ought not to intermeddle in Secular Affairs.</hi> The fifth point is a <hi>Salvo</hi> for the two Univerſities, but none for the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> nor for the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> not for the Dean of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> their next Neighbour, who is eſtabliſh'd in his Government by an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Act of Parliament, that of the 27 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The ſixth and laſt point is a <hi>Salvo</hi> for Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, Barons, or Peers of this Kingdom, that either may be, or are ſuch by Deſcent: Which Clauſe, I hope in God, will prove not only a <hi>Salvo</hi> to thoſe honourable perſons (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if we of the Clergy were but ſo happy as to have any competent number of our Coat, <hi>Quot Thebarum portae, vel divit is oſtia Nili,</hi> this Bill ſurely had periſh'd in the Womb, and never come to the Birth) but I hope that this Clauſe will prove this Bill a <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> and a Murtherer of it ſelf; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for a <hi>Salvo</hi> to noble Miniſters only, prove a <hi>Salvo</hi> for all other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that be not ſo happy as to be nobly born; becauſe the very poor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for ought we find in Scripture, or common Reaſon, is no more tyed to ſerve God in his Vocation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and nobly-born Miniſters are. And therefore I hope thoſe noble Miniſters will deal ſo nobly, as to pull their Brethren the poor Miniſters out of the Thorns and Bryars of this Bill. And theſe are all the true Heads and Contents of this Bill: And among theſe ſix Heads your Lordſhips ſhall be ſure to find me; and I ſhall expect to ſind your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in the whole Tract of this Committee. And now, with your Lordſhips honourable Leave and Patience, I will run them over, almoſt as briefly as I have pointed and pricked them down.</q>

160. <q>For the firſt, the Riſe and Motive of this Bill, which is the Duty of Men in Holy Orders not to intermeddle with Secular Affairs, muſt either riſe from a point of Divinity, or from a point of Conveniency or Policy: And I hope in God it will not appear to your Lordſhips, that there is any Ground either of Divinity or Policy to inhibit men in Orders, ſo modeſtly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with Secular Affairs, as that the meaſure of intermeddling in ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs ſhall not hinder nor obſtruct the Duties of their Calling: They ought not ſo to intermeddle in Secular Affairs, as to neglect their Miniſtry; no more ought Lay-men neither; for they have a Calling and Vocation, wherein they are to walk, as Miniſters have; they have Wife, and Children, and Families to care for, and they are not to neglect theſe to live upon Warrants and Recognizances, to become a kind of Sir <hi>Francis Michel,</hi> or a <hi>Juſtus nimis,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.16.

But that men in Holy Orders ought not, in a moderate manner, together with the Duties of their Calling, to help and aſſiſt in the Government of the Common-wealth, if they be thereunto lawfully called by the Soveraign Prince, can never be proved by any good Divinity; for in the Law of Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e before the Deluge, and a long time after, it is a point that no man will deny me, That the Eldeſt of the Family was both the Prieſt and the Magiſtrate: Then the People were taken out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> among his Prieſts, as it is in the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Then there was a Form of a Common-wealth ſetch'd from Heaven indeed, and planted upon the Earth, and judiciary Laws dictated for the regulating of the ſame. Nor do I much care, though ſome men ſhall ſay, <hi>That perſons in Holy Orders ought not to intermeddle in Secular Affairs,</hi> when that Great God of Heaven and Earth doth appoint them to intermeddle with all the principal Affairs of that eſtate: witneſs the exorbitant Power of the High-Prieſt in Secular Matters, the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> the 23, the Judges of the Gate, which were moſt of them Prieſts and Levites. And the Church-men of that Eſtate were not all Butchers and Slaughter-men, for they had their Tabernacle, their Synagogues, their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Preaching, and other Exerciſes of Piety. In a word, we have <hi>Divinius,</hi> but they had <hi>operoſius miniſterium,</hi> as St <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh. Our Miniſtry takes up more of our Thoughts, but theirs took up more of their Labour and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Nor is it any matter that this Common-wealth is no more in being: it ſufficeth it hath been once, and that planted by God himſelf, who would never have appointed perſons in Holy Orders to intermeddle with things they ought not to intermeddle withal. I will go on with my Chronology of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Holy Orders, and only put you in mind of <hi>Ely,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> among the Judges, of <hi>Sadock</hi>'s Employment under K. <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Jehojada</hi>'s under his Nephew King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and would ſain know what Hurt theſe men in Holy Orders did, by intermedling in Secular Affairs of that time.

The Civil Power is a Divine Ordinance, ſet up to be a Terror to the Evil, and an Encouragement to Good Works. This is the whole compaſs of the Civil Power: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore I do here demand, with the moſt learned Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> that within a few days did ſit by my ſide, in the Eleventh Queſtion of his Determinations, <hi>What is there of Impiety, what of Unlawfulneſs, what unbecoming either the Holineſs or Calling of a Prieſt, in terrifying the bad, or comforting the good Subject, in repreſſing of Sin, or puniſhing of Sinners?</hi> For this is the whole and entire act of Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. It is in its own nature repugnant to no Perſon, to no Function, to no fort or condition of Men, let them hold themſelves never ſo holy, never ſo ſeraphical, it becomes them very well to repreſs Sin and puniſh Sinners; that is to ſay, to exerciſe in a moderate manner Civil Juriſdiction, if the Soveraign ſhall require it: And you ſhall find that this Doctrine of debarring perſons in Holy Orders from Secular Employments, is no Doctrine of the Reformed, but the Popiſh Church, and firſt brought into this Kingdom by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Lambeth, Lanfrank, Anſelm, Stephen Langton,</hi> and the reſt, together with <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Ottobon,</hi> and to this only end, that the man of <hi>Rome</hi> might withdraw all the Clergy of this Kingdom from their obligation to the King and Nobility, who were moſt of them great Princes in thoſe times, and thereby might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and create (as in great part he did) <hi>Regnum in Regno,</hi> a Kingdom of Shavelings in the midſt of this Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> And hence came thoſe

That is in plain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, the Prieſt muſt no longer receive Obligations from either King or Lords, but wholly depend upon his Holy Fathers, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope of <hi>Lambeth;</hi> or at leaſt wiſe, pay him ſoundly for their Diſpenſations and Abſolutions, when they preſume to do the contrary. In the mean time here is not one word or ſhew of Reaſon, to inform an underſtanding man, that perſons in Holy Orders ought not to terriſie the Bad and comfort the Good, to repreſs Sin, and chaſtiſe Sinners; which is the <hi>ſumma totalis</hi> of the Civil Magiſtracy, and conſequently ſo far forth, at the leaſt, to intermeddle with Secular Affairs. And this is all that I ſhall ſay touching the Motive and Ground of this Bill, and that perſons in Holy Orders ought not to be inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited from intermeddling in Secular Aſtairs, either in point of Divinity, or in point of Conveniency and Policy.</q>

                        </gap>ident will be ever ſound, that the Prelates were ever excluded, otherwiſe than by their own Folly, Fear, or Headineſs. For the point of being Juſtices of Peace, the Gentleman confeſſeth, he never meddled with Archbiſhops, nor Biſhops, nor with any Clergyman made a Juſtice by His Majeſty's Commiſſion. In the Statute made 34 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. he finds Aſſignees for the keeping of the Peace, one Lord, three or four of the moſt valiant men of the County; the troubleſome times did then ſo require it: And if God do not bleſs us with the riddance of theſe two Armies, the like Proviſion will be now as neceſſary. He finds theſe men included, but he doth not find Churchmen excluded; no, not in the Statute 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. <hi>c.</hi> 7. that requires Juſtices of Peace to be made of Knights, Eſquires, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Law, of the moſt ſufficient of each County. In which words the Gentleman thinks Clerks were not included; and I clearly ſay, by his favour, they are not excluded; nor do the learned Sages of the Law conceive them to be excluded by that Statute. If the King ſhall command the Lord Keeper to fill up the Commiſſions of each County, with the moſt ſufficient Knights, Eſquires, and Gentlemen of the Law, ſhall the Lord Keeper thereupon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Noblemen and the Prelates? I have often in my days received this Command, but never heard of this Interpretation before this time: So that I cannot conceive from what ground this general Sweepſtake of Archbiſhops, Bithops, Parſons, Vicars, and all others in Holy Orders ſhould proceed. I have heard, ſince the beginning of my Sickneſs, that it hath been alledg'd in this Houſe, that the Clergy, in the Sixth of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. did diſavow that the Cuſtody of the Peace did belong to them at all, and I believe that ſuch a thing is to be ſound among the Notes of the Privileges of this Houſe; but firſt, you muſt remember, that it was in a great Storm, and when the Waters were much troubled, and the wild People unapt to be kept in order by Miters, and Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier-ſtaves: But yet if that noble Lord ſhall be pleaſed to caſt his Eye upon the Roll it ſelf, he ſhall find that this poor Excuſe did not ſerve the Prelates turns; for they were compelled with a witneſs to defend the preſervation of the Peace of the Kingdom for their parts, as well as the Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And you ſhall find the Ordinance to this effect ſet down upon that Roll. I conclude therefore, with that noble Lord's favour, that the ſweeping of all the Clergy out of temporal Offices, is a motion of the firſt impreſſion, and was never heard in the Engliſh Common-wealth before this Bill.</q>

164. <q>I come, in the third place, to the main part of this Cauſe, the things to be ſevered from all men in Holy Orders, which are, as I told you of three kinds: 1. Matters of Free-hold, as the Biſhops Votes in Parliament, and Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative Power. 2. Matters of Favour, to be a Judge in <hi>Star-chamber;</hi> to be a a Privy-Councillor, to be a Juſtice of Peace, or a Commiſſioner in any Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affairs. 3. Mixt Matters of Free-hold and Favour too, as the Charters of ſome Biſhops, and many of the ancient Cathedrals of this Kingdom, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them a Juſtice or two within themſelves, or their Cloſe, as they call it, and exempt thoſe grave and learned men from the Rudeneſs and Inſolency of Tapſters, Brewers, Inn-keepers, Taylors, and Shoe-makers, which do integrate and make up the Bodies of our Country-Cities and Incorporations. And now is the Ax laid to the very Root of the Eccleſiaſtical Tree, and without your Lordſhips Juſtice and Favour, all the Branches are to be lopt off quite with thoſe latter Clauſes, and the Stock and Root it ſelf to be quite grubb'd and digged up, by that firſt point of aboliſhing all Vote and Legiſlative Power in all Clergymen, leaving them to be no longer any part of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> but meer Slaves and Bond-men to all intents and purpoſes; and the Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> one degree interiour to the Prieſts of <hi>Jer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now I hope no Engliſh-man will doubt, but this Vote and Repreſentation in Parliament is not only a Freehold, but the greateſt Freehold that any Subject in <hi>England,</hi> or in all the Chriſtian World, can brag of at this day, that we live under a King, and are to be govern'd by his Laws, that is, not by his arbitrary Edicts or Reſcripts, but by ſuch Laws confirmed by him, and aſſented to by us, either in our proper Perſons, or in our Aſſignees and Repreſentations. This is the very Soul and Genius of our <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and without this one Spirit that great Statute is little leſs than <hi>litera occidens,</hi> a dead and uſeleſs piece of Paper: You heard it moſt truly ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto you by a wiſe and judicious Peer of this Houſe, that <hi>Legem patere quam ipſe tuleris,</hi> was a Motto, wherein <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> had not more intereſt than every true-born Engliſhman. No Forty-ſhillings-man in <hi>England,</hi> but doth in perſon or repreſentation enjoy his Freedom and Liberty: The Prelates of this Kingdom, as a Looking-glaſs and Repreſentation of the Clergy, a third eſtate, if we may ſpeak either with Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> or the ancient Acts of Parliament, have been in poſſeſſion hereof theſe Thouſand years and upward. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Norman</hi> Race, indeed, for their own ends, and to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Men and Money, erected the Biſhopricks ſoon after the Conqueſt into Baronies, and left them to ſit in the Houſe, with their double Capacities about them; the latter invented for the profit of the Prince, not excluding the former, remaining always from the beginning, for the profit and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the poor Clergy, and the State Eccleſiaſtical: which appears not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws ſet forth by Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> and Sir <hi>H. Spelman,</hi> but alſo by the Biſhops Writs and Summons to Parliament, in uſe to this very day. We have many Preſident, upon the Rolls, that in vacancy of Epiſcopal Sees, the Guardian of the Spirituals, though but a ſimple Prieſt, hath been called to fit in this Honourable Houſe, by reaſon of the former Repreſentation: and ſuch an Officer I was my ſelf over that See whereof I am Biſhop, ſome 25 years ago, and might then have been ſummoned by Writ to this Honourable Houſe, at <hi>that</hi> very time, by reaſon of keeping the Spirituality of <hi>that</hi> Dioceſs, which then, as a ſimple Prieſt, I did, by vertue of the aforeſaid Office repreſent. And therefore, moſt noble Lords, look upon the Ark of God's Repreſentative, that at this time floats in great danger in this Deluge of Waters: If there be any Cham or unclean Creature therein, out with him, and let every man bear his own Burden, but ſave the Ark for God and Chriſt Jeſus ſake, who hath built it in this Kingdom for ſaving of People. And your Lordſhips are too wiſe to conceive that the Word and Sacraments, the means of our Salvation, will be ever effectually received from thoſe Miniſters, whoſe Perſons ſhall be ſo vilified and dejected, as to be made no Parcels or Fragments of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. <hi>No,</hi> faith <hi>Gregory, the laſt Trick the Devil had in this World was this, that when he could not bring the Word and Sacraments into diſgrace by Errors and Heretical Opintens, he invented this Project,</hi> (and much applauded his Wit therein) <hi>to caſt Slight and Contempt upon the Preachers and Miniſters.</hi> And my noble Lords, you are too wiſe to believe what the common people talk, that we have a Vote in the election of Knights and Burgeſſes, and conſequently ſome Figure and Repreſentation in the noble Houſe of Commons They of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49492:206"/>have no Vote in theſe Elections, they have no Repreſentation in that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe, and the contrary Aſſertions are ſo ſlight and groundleſs, as I will not offer to give them any anſwer. And therefore, R. Hon. Lords, have a ſpecial care of the Church of <hi>England</hi> your Mother in this point. And as God hath made you the moſt noble of all the Peers of the Chriſtian World, ſo do not you give way that our Nobility ſhall be taught henceforth, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were in the time of the firſt and ſecond Punick Wars, by their Slaves and Bond-men only: and that the Church of God in this Iſland may come to be ſerved by the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble Miniſters, that have ever been ſeen in the Chriſtian Church, ſince the Paſſion of our Saviour. And ſo much for the firſt thing, which this Bill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends of ſever from Perſons in Holy Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> Votes and Repreſentations in Parliament. The next thing to be ſevered from them by this Bill is of a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Mettal and Alloy, ſittings in Star-Chamber, ſittings at Council-Table, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Commiſſions of Peace, and other Commiſſions of Secular Affairs, which are ſuch Favours and Graces of Chriſtian Princes, as the Church may have a being, and ſubſiſtence without them. The Fartunes of our <hi>Greece</hi> do not depend upon theſe Spangles: and the Soveraign Prince hath imparted and withdrawn theſe kind of Favours without the envy or regret of any wiſe Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ical Perſons. But, my noble Lords, this is the Caſe; our King hath by the Statute reſtored unto him the Headſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Word of God, he is <hi>Cuſtos utriuſque tabulae.</hi> And will your Lordſhips al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Eccleſiaſtical Head no Eccleſiaſtical Senſes at all? No Eccleſiaſtical Perſon to be conſulted withal, not in any circumſtance of Time and Place? If <hi>Cranmer</hi> had been thus dealt withal in the minority of our young King <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth of pious memory, what had become of the great Work of our Reformation in this flouriſhing Church of <hi>England?</hi> But I know before whom I ſpeak. I do not mean to Dine your Lordſhips with Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worts: the harſh Conſequents of this Point your Lordſhips do underſtand as well as I. The laſt Robe that ſome Perſons in Holy Orders are to be ſtript of, hath a kind of Mixture of Freehold and Favour, of the proper Right and Graces of the King, which are certain old Charters, that ſome few Biſhops, and many Ancient and Cathedral Churches have purchaſed and procured from the ancient Kings, before and ſince the Conqueſt, to inable them to live quiet in their own Precincts, and cloſe (as they call it) under a Juſtice or two of their own Body, without being abandoned, upon every ſlight occaſion, to the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Vexations of Mechanical Tradeſmen, of which your Lordſhips beſt know thoſe Country Incorporations do moſt conſiſt. Now whether theſe ſew Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have their Foundation by Favour or by Right, I ſhould conceive, under your Lordſhips ſavour, it is neither Favour nor Right to take them away, without ſome juſt Crime objected and proved. For if they be abuſed in any particular, Mr. Attorney-General can find an ordinary Remedy to repair the ſame by a Writ of <hi>Ad quod damnum,</hi> without troubling the two Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And this is all I ſhall ſpeak to this Point.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="165">165. <q>And now I am come to the fourth part of this Bill, which is the manner of Inhibition, heavy every way: heavy in the Penalty, heavier a great deal in the Incapacity. For the weighing of the Penalty will you conſider, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, the ſmall Wyres, that is, poor Cauſes, that are to induce the ſame: and then the heavy Lead that hangs upon thoſe Wyres. It is thus: If a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subject of <hi>England,</hi> intereſſed in the <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> as well as any other, yet being a Perſon in Holy Orders, ſhall happen unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately to Vote in Parliament, to obey his Prince by way of Counſel, or by way of a Commiſſioner be required thereunto, then he is preſently to loſe and forfeit for his firſt offence all his means and livelyhood for one year and for the ſecond to forfeit his Freehold in that kind for ever and ever. And I do not believe that your Lordſhips ever ſaw ſuch an heavy weight of Cenſure hang upon ſuch thin Wyres of Reaſon in an Act of Parliament made heretofore. This perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture may move others moſt, but it does not me. It is not the Penalty, but the Incapacity, and as the Philoſopher would call it, the Natural Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency impoſed by this Bill on Men in Holy Orders to ſerve the King, or the State in this kind, be they never ſo able, never ſo willing, never ſo vertuous. Which makes me draw a kind of <hi>Timanthes</hi> vail over this Point, and leave it, without any amplification at all, unto your Lordſhips wiſe and inward thoughts and conſiderations.—The fifth Point is the <hi>Salvo</hi> made for the two Univerſities, to have Juſtices of Peace among them of their own Heads of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49492:206"/>Houſes, which I confeſs to be done upon mature and juſt conſideration: For otherwiſe the Scholars muſt have gone for Juſtice to thoſe Parties to whom they ſend for Muſtard and Vineger. But yet, under favour, the Reaſons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements cannot be ſtronger than may be found out for other Eccleſiaſtical Perſons; as the Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> who was ever, ſince the days of K. <hi>John,</hi> ſuffered by the Princes and Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> to exerciſe Juſtice upon the Parties in thoſe Parts, as being in truth the King's Subjects, but the Biſhops Tenants, and therefore not likely to have their Cauſes more duly weighed, than when the Balance is left in the hand of their own proper Landlord. The Caſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> for ſome parts of that Iſle is not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. But if a little Partiality doth not herein caſt ſome little Miſt before mine eyes, the Caſe of the Dean and City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein this Parliament is now ſitting, is far more conſiderable, both in the Antiquity, extent of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and the Warrants whereupon it is grounded, than any one of thoſe places before mentioned. For there is a clear Statute made 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for the drawing all <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> St. <hi>Clement,</hi> and St. <hi>Martins le Grand, London,</hi> into a Corporation to be reigled by a Dean, a Steward, twelve Burgeſſes, and twelve Aſſiſtants: And if ſome Salve or Plaiſter ſhall not be applied to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in this Point, all that Government and Corporation is at an end. But this I perceive ſince is taken into conſideration by the Honourable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons themſelves.—I come now to the laſt Point, and the ſecond <hi>Salvo</hi> of this Bill, which is for Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, Barons or Peers of this Kingdom; which is a Clauſe that looks with a kind of contrary glance upon Perſons in Holy Orders: it ſeems to favour ſome, but ſo that thereby, and in that very act, it caſts an aſperſion of baſeneſs and ignobility upon all the reſt of that Holy Profeſſion. For if no Perſons in Holy Orders ought to intermeddle in Secular Affairs, how come thoſe Nobles to be excepted out of the Univerſal Negative? Is it becauſe they are nobly born? Then ſurely it muſt be granted that the reſt muſt be excluded, as being made of a worſer and rougher piece of Clay. For the ſecond part of this Reaſon in the beginning of the Bill can never bear out this <hi>Salvo, That the Office of the Miniſtry is of ſo great importance, that it will take up the whole Man, and all his beſt Endeavours.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Office of the Miniſtry is of no greater importance in a poor man than in a noble man; nor doth it take up the whole Man in the one, and but a piece of him in the other. I cannot give you many Inſtances herein out of Scripture, becauſe you know that in thoſe days, <hi>Not many mighty, not many noble were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26.

But it is lawful, all this notwithſtanding, for the noble born Miniſter to intermeddle in Secular Affairs, and therefore it is likewiſe lawful for the mean born ſo to do. And ſo in may Conſcience (I ſpeak it in the preſence of God, and great Noblemen) it is moſt lawful for them to intermeddle with Secular Affairs, ſo as they be not intangled (as the Apoſtle calls it) with this intermedling, as to ſlight and neglect the Office of their Calling; which no Miniſter, noble or ignoble, can do without grievouſly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God and his own conſcience. It is lawful for Perſons in Holy Orders to intermeddle; it is without queſtion: or elſe they could not make proviſion of Meat and Drink, as <hi>Beza</hi> interprets the place.

Here is my Mars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, and further I ſhall never appeal for Juſtice. Some aſſurance I have from
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49492:207"/>the late ſolemn Vow and Proteſtation of both Houſes, for the maintaining and defending the Power and Priviledges of Parliament, that if this Bill were now to be framed in the one Houſe, it would never be offered, without much qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, and I perſwade my ſelf it will not be approved in the other. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments are indeed Omnipotent; but no more Omnipotent than God himſelf; who, for all that, cannot do every thing. God cannot but perform what he hath promiſed: A Parliament, under favour, cannot un-ſwear what it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vowed. This is an old Maxim, which I have learned of the Sages of the Law, A Parliament cannot be <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> it cannot deſtroy or undo it ſelf. An Act of Parliament, (as that in the eleventh, and another in the one and twentieth of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second) made to be unrepealable in any ſubſequent Parliament, was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> void in the conſtitution. Why? becauſe it took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Power and Priviledges, that is, not the Plumes and Feathers, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Accidents, but the very ſpeciſial Form, Eſſence, and Being of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So if an Act ſhould be made to take away the Votes of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, or all the Lords, it were abſolutely a void Act. I will conclude with the firſt Ep. to the <hi>Corinthians, c.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>If the ſoot ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the hand I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</hi> v. 20. <hi>but now are they many Members, yet but one Body.</hi> v. 21. <hi>And the eye cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head unto the feet, I have no need of you.</hi>

The Succeſs was, that he laid the Bill aſleep for five months (for I confeſs that by over-ſight I have not kept the juſt order of time; for it ſhould have been referred to the middle of <hi>May,</hi> before the King went into <hi>Scotland</hi>) and was in a trance by the charm of this Eloquence till <hi>November</hi> after: which ſhews how like he was to <hi>Athanaſius (Nazian. in Orat. pro codem)</hi>

I am certain theſe were Traytors, that begirt the King's Houſe, where his Perſon was, with Hoſtility by Land and Water: He that ſpeaks of them without deteſtation, allows them, and makes way for the like.

Secondly, They know beſt, whether they were in Fear or no, who ſubſcribed or agreed to the Petition. And my Lord of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> agreed in it as much as the reſt, and inſtanced in the cauſe of his Fear, his chaſing to <hi>Lambeth.</hi> Thirdly, For the other part of the Objection, the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was then at <hi>Fulham, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> in <hi>Kent, Worceſter</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi> nor doth the Title of the Petition compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, as not being about <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter.

A Proteſtation annulleth no Law, but ſo far as the Law ſhall extend to the Parties proteſting: Nor ſo far, but in caſe that the Parties proteſting ſhall afterward judicially prove their right to annull that Law: So that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any Proteſtation of the Biſhops ſhould actually intend to hinder the Relief of <hi>Ireland.</hi> 2 The Relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> by 10000 <hi>Scots</hi> and 10000 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and concluded long before this Proteſtation, and all the Particulars of that great buſineſs referr'd to a Committee of both Houſes and the Biſhops unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly aſſented thereto: So that the Relief of <hi>Ireland</hi> comes not within the Date and Circumſcription of this Proteſtation. And the Biſhops call God to witneſs, they never conceived one Thought that way. 3. The Biſhops proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt no Laws or Orders at all to be annulled abſolutely, and for all the time of this Seſſion of Parliament ſimply, but for that ſpace of time only, wherein they ſhould be forcibly and violently kept from the ſaid Parliament, by thoſe rude and unruly People. So that as ſoon as the King and the Lords did quiet their paſſage unto Parliament, (which the Lords did do before this Petition was read in Parliament) and that any of the Biſhops were preſent there, the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was directly null, and of none effect; ſo as indeed the Proteſtation was void and dead in Law, before the L. Keeper brought the Petition in queſtion into the Houſe; becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſome others, had even then quiet acceſs unto that Honourable Houſe. And the Biſhops conceived the Proteſtation void in ſuch a caſe, and do moſt humbly wave and revoke the ſame, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſire both Houſes to accept thereof.</p>

And it will appear among the Records of that moſt Honourable Houſe (11 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. <hi>num.</hi> 9.) that the King in that Houſe hath commanded the like Proteſtation of the Biſhops to be enrolled, which made the Biſhops uſe that Phraſe. Howbeit, beſide the King's Command, the Aſſent of the Peers and Commons have ſtill concurred, and the Biſhops never conceived it otherwiſe; which made them preſume, that no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their Proteſtation could poſſibly amount to any higher Crime than that of Error or Miſtake, conſidering that it was ſtill to be admitted or rejected by the King, with the Aſſent of the Peers and Commons.</p>
                  <p>Here the Anſwer ends, in this brief compaſs: Let all the Council in the Land plead againſt it, and ſhew where it is not ſound and ſatisfactory.

The method of Sacrilege was, firſt to pluck the Spiritual Lords out of the Houſe, and to diſable all the Clergy from intermedling in Secular Affairs. The Bill is read, and eaſily paſs'd, now the Biſhops were not in place to hear it, and diſpute it.

It would ill become a Royal Spirit, to plead he was compelled by Fear, elſe His Majeſty might have revoked this Act upon that Challenge. As Sir <hi>Nic.

Being at <hi>Dover,</hi> the Queen would not part with the King to Ship-board, till he ſigned this Bill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to believe by all proteſtation of Faith from Sir <hi>John Culpepper,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended there for that Diſpatch, that the Lords and Commons would preſs His Majeſty to no more Bills of that unpleaſing nature: So the King ſnatch'd gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily at a Flower of a fair Offer; and though he truſted few of the men at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> yet in outward ſhew he would ſeem to truſt them all, the more, becauſe the Queen had ſuch Confidence in them. How <hi>Culpepper</hi> inſtilled this into the Queen, and how ſhe prevailed, <hi>York</hi> is my Author, and could not deceive me, for he told me in the <hi>Tower, That the King had ſacrificed the Clergy to this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Artifices contrived at</hi> Dover, <hi>a day before the News were brought to</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Then they fell to Bells and Bonfires, and prophaned the Name of God, that <hi>He had heard them,</hi> whoſe Glory was not in their Thoughts from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end. A Day-labourer lifts up his Ax towards Heaven, but ſtrikes his Mattock into the Earth. And all the Evil that the Earth breeds was in their Mind, when they ſeemed to look up to God.

Until that day he had not ſeen the place, from which he was entitled; which he had propoſed to be the Scene wherein he would do the part of an Archbiſhop in great ſplendor. His Means were ſufficient; his Inclinations very hoſpital; Proviſions abundant in that Country: the Gentry addicted to Liberality, or rather Profuſeneſs: no man was ever ſo cut out to pleaſe them, ſince <hi>Alex.

There are Miſchiefs approaching when common bodings miſgive them: which were not diſcerned ſoon enough, through fatal Security, before they were ripened. As <hi>Budaeus</hi> writes of <hi>France</hi> upon the firſt breaking out of Wars at home, That <hi>France</hi> wanted eyes, and ears, and, which is ſtrange, they wanted a Noſe; <hi>Qui cladem adventantem odora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri ante non potuimus, quàm ab eâ oppreſſi,</hi> Lib. 4. de Aſſe, fol. 110. The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, thoſe <hi>Scalda-banco</hi>'s, or hot Declamers, had wrought a great diſtaſt in the Commons at the King, and at all that had his ear and favour. The Age grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Learned, and Knowledge puffing up, Scholars grew more impudent and malapert with us, and in every ſtate, than did become their Function. Our much Peace, which had laſted almoſt two Jubilees, was ſeeded with great Vice in our manners. Young men lived idly, which made them want, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were ready for Buſtles and Commotions to boot-hale and conſume: they that propoſed to themſelves no laborious kind of Life, expected Alterations, and then to have enough to laviſh.

And when Wars broke out, they crept out of their Cranies, like the Cimici in the Houſes of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> not of rotten Bedſteds. But the Parliament, our continual Hectick, did lend their Arm to all Miſchief, to uſher it in. They could not bow the King to all their Votes, and abaſe him to be contented with a ſhadow of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore they ranged every thing to a War, as palpably, as if their Drums and Colours had been in the Fields. <hi>Bacchae Bacchanti ſi velis adverſarier, Inſanam inſaniorem facies: feriet ſaepiùs.</hi> Plauti Frag.

As <hi>Ruſſinus</hi> very well upon the Creed, <hi>Nihil eſt quod in vitâ geri poſſit, ſi non credulitas ante praeceſſerit.</hi> The City of <hi>London</hi> came in for a great ſhare, to encourage the drawing of the Sword; provided that the War came not near their Lines of Communication. This City, the Epitome of <hi>England,</hi> marr'd all <hi>England:</hi> as <hi>S.

But the worſt of them all durſt never have been ſo ſtout, if the Parliament had not held up their Spirit in their wickedneſs. And there was a Nation, that ſhall not ſcape me, that whiſtled to the Jades that plowed up the Furrows of our Land, and gave them Provendore, I mean the <hi>French:</hi> to whom yet I will aſcribe what <hi>Magius</hi> the <hi>Patavine</hi> doth, <hi>Gens bellicoſiſſima, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noriſque appetontiſſima.</hi> It hath a ſtock of very noble Gentry, but ſick of two faults, they abhor the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> hate the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and wiſh the Confuſion of both: which may turn upon themſelves. They object how we aſſaulted them at <hi>Rhee:</hi> but forget what we did for them at <hi>Amiens,</hi> and <hi>Calis.</hi> They remember King <hi>Charles</hi> his Navy at <hi>Rochel:</hi> but take no notice of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Harry</hi> the Fourth to the Crown, in ſpite of the Leaguers. Theſe kindled the Brands that ſet their Neighbours Houſe on fire: which lyes ſleeping under the Aſhes of our memory; and they may repent it when they want us. Now what banding here was on every ſide, to ruin the greateſt Saint that ever ruled our Nation? God was in them that came about him with their homage in ſuch a time of hazard. <hi>Magna negotia magnis adjutoribus egent.</hi> Paterc.

The laſt Article was broken, and nothing was ſaved from the top to the bottom from the plunder of the Souldiers: But God provided that his Perſon was ſaved, whom the Lyons Whelp would have murder'd in cold Blood: <hi>Quàm pome furvae regna Proſerpinae, &amp;c.</hi> Horat.

One Argument of the Adverſaries is, That once upon a time, they know not when, Men were gathered out of Deſarts and Savageneſs into a body, to live ſociably, and it was their Courteſie then to ſet up ſuch a King as did pleaſe them: He is but the Peoples Creature, therefore in his firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and always, at their mercy. This is a Tale put together of a thing out of the Memory of all Writers; which were it true, as it is unlikely, it will come to nothing. If the People did part with their Right to a King, to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and defended in Wealth and Peace, their Act is irrevocable, the Bond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble. Though <hi>Democritus</hi> thought his Atoms might concurr to make a World, yet the World being made, thoſe Atoms could not fall aſunder again to diſſolve the World. Conceive we were in <hi>Polonia</hi> at this day, the Eligents, who make the King by their Vote, are tyed faſt by their Oaths and Faith, to their own Act. Nor do they give the King his Power, but deſign his Perſon, becauſe Election is not an Act of Power, but of Privilege. That a Monarch is not greater than the Univerſe of his People, whether it look like ſomewhat to the weakneſs of Sence, I know not, but it is nothing to Reaſon; for Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be made between things of the ſame kind. Mark then. A part of the Body is leſs than the whole Body in magnitude, but the Soul, though one part of Man, and no more, is greater in Virtue than all the Body. The intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Faculty is but one Faculty, yet greater in Dignity and Regency than all the Faculties of the Soul beſide. The <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> adhering to the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> tell us, That a Pope is leſs than a whole general Council; they give him Honour and Place before any ſingle Prelate, Metropolitan, or Patriarch, by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Conſtitution, yet he is inferiour to an Oecumenial Synod <hi>in totâ,</hi> becauſe he comprehends not in his Office the Vertue of the Catholick Church, for that's an Uſurpation: But the Vertual Power of the Kingdom is in the King, which diſcovers the odds of the Compariſon. Our Politico's alſo object, that the People were before the King. Not before him, if Soveraignity grew firſt out of Paternal Right, (and ſo it did for certain in <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Father, and firſt King.) Yet grant them their asking, here is an Inſtance to ſilence them: All the Creatures were made before Man, yet God gave him the Dominion to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49492:220"/>them that were created before and after him. It is to no more purpoſe to cavil, That the King is made for the good of the People. Is that which is appointed for the good of another the leſs for that Cauſe? Quite contrary, 'tis therefore the greater. So is a Preceptor and Shepherd, the one above the Scholars, the other above the Flock. <hi>Saravia</hi> diſtinguiſheth skilfully, <hi>de Obed. p.</hi> 228. <hi>Quod eſt propter aliud, ſi beneſicium ab co accipit, minus eſl, ſi dat majus eſt.</hi> They ſtretch their Wit further, and ſay, <hi>That the King gives his Oath to his Subjects, to mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam them in their known Laws.</hi> It well befits him. So God gave an Oath to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David, Quare juramentum, praeſ itum Inſeriori, non ei ſubjicn Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi> ſays the ſame Author. As for the matter of the <hi>Oath,</hi> to keep the Laws, it puts him not under the Wrath of Men, if he do not keep them, but under the Wrath of God. A King is to keep the Laws of Nations with other Princes, yet is not ſubject to them. God defend us from making Experiments, what would come to paſs if the choice of a Governor or Governors were referred to the thouſands and millions of <hi>England.</hi> Beware a Heptarchy again, beware an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catontarchy.

Preſently he ſet forward, (though the ways were much beſet) and came in <hi>January</hi> with the firſt to the King, for he had many things to repreſent, and was not in his Element when he was conſined in private Walls.

He was received in the Court with much Grace, where he ſaw his ſtay muſt be ſhort.

After great Conſult in Parliament, when the beſt Oratours had been fully heard, it was unanimouſly reſolved, that this Share of Parliament ſhould ſend a Meſſage to the other Share, (with Leave obtained from their General the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>) for His Majeſty's Safety, to come to <hi>London,</hi> for ſuſpenſion of Arms, to fill up the Houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with one Body, all Affronts on both ſides to be obliterated, and Conditions for Amity for the future, and the Publick Good to be propounded.

The <hi>Welſh</hi> made ſome high Demands, which were not heard patiently. They perceived <hi>Milton</hi>'s mind was at the Caſtle, where the Archbiſhop's Wealth, and of divers far and near was depoſited, which was ready to come every jot into the Colonels power; whom they perceived to be rather haughty than covetous, and they cloſed by inſinuations with him, relating how Sir <hi>J. Owen</hi> had ſurprized the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49492:229"/>Caſtle, detained their Goods, and inſulted over them, who had born Arms in the ſame Cauſe, therefore they offer'd to joyn with him to put him into the Caſtle, with condition that every Proprietary might obtain what he could prove by the Archbiſhops Inventory to belong to him, and for the Overplus, let it fall to the Colonels Mercy; whoſe Conſent the Archbiſhop's Art and fair Language drew on. And not the leaſt time being ſpent in delay, the Soldiers entred the Caſtle both by Scalada, and by forcing the Gates, aſſiſted by the Archbiſhop's Kindred, and other <hi>Welch;</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> kept the Caſtle, and kept his Word, to let the Owners divide the Goods among themſelves, to which they laid Title, and could prove it. Let another take the Archbiſhop's room, and diſcharge it better. That which was loſt, the Caſtle, could not be kept; that which was ſaved helpt the King's Friends to ſubſiſt, which his gracious goodneſs would allow. Yes, but <hi>Milton</hi> was a Rebel. And may not a Rebel be uſed to do acts of Juſtice or Charity? <hi>Licet uti alieno peccato,</hi> is often allowed in moſt conſcion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Divinity.

Here's the caſe, and all the caſe, upon whoſe miſ-report the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop's good Name did ſuffer deeply.

His Grace of <hi>York</hi> turn'd that Prophetick Conceipt into a Religious Practice: Dr. <hi>Floyd,</hi> a Religious Divine, Preaching a Sermon at his Funeral, extolled the moſt Reverend Father's Devotion, That from the heavy time of the King's Death, he roſe every midnight out of his Bed, and having nothing but his Shirt and Weſtcoat upon him, kneeled on his bare Knees, and pray'd earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſtrongly one quarter of an hour, before he went to his Reſt again. I will inform Dr. <hi>Floyd</hi> in two things, which he knew not: <hi>Firſt,</hi> He obſerv'd the ſeaſon of Midnight, becauſe the Scriptures ſpeak of Chriſt's coming to judge the Quick and the Dead at Midnight. It is true, according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun and Stars, it will be Day as well as Night in ſome Climate of the World, but very like to be Night, that is, cloudy Darkneſs over all the Earth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The matter of his Prayer was principally this; <hi>Come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, come quickly, and put an end to theſe days of Sin and Miſery.</hi> So much I learnt from himſelf, and ſo report it. His days were conſumed in Heavineſs, as his Nights in Mourning: Facetiouſneſs, in which he was ſingular, came no more out of his Lips, he ceaſed from Diſcourſe, from Company, as he could, and nothing could hale him out of this Obſcurity.

Which Benefit, not I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, but ſuch as are younger may live to ſee: as the old Father ſaid to his Son in <hi>Plaut. Trin.

Yet in thoſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I have not ſet down a <hi>Cyrus,</hi> a feigned Subject, but wrought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true Image of this Prelate. So <hi>Nazianzen</hi> informs us, that when <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> drew out the Life of <hi>Anthony</hi> the Hermite, <gap reason="foreign">

Some are cheated with Wit now-a-days after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion, and had rather Men ſhould be commended in Romances of Perſons, that were never extant, than in ſuch as lived among us, truly deſerved Glory, and did us good. My Subject is real, and not umbratick; a Man of as deep and large wiſdom as I did ever ſpeak with; and I fear not to ſay of him, as <hi>Laelius</hi> doth of <hi>Cato major, Aut enim nemo, quod quidem magis credo; aut, ſi quis uſquam, ille ſapiens fuit:</hi> He was conſtant to that Religion wherein he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techized, and inſtructed in it more perfectly in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> A punctual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the ancient Church Orders, whereof he was a Governour, and a great decliner of innovations, holding to it, that what was long in uſe, if it were not beſt, it was fitteſt for the People. He taſted equally of great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Adverſity, and was a rare Example in both, like <hi>Lollius</hi> in <hi>Horace,</hi>

And it had been better for him, if he had known a meek temper, and how
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49492:234"/>to be reſiſted. Otherwiſe his Vertues were ſuper-excellent. A great Devotee to publick and private Prayer: There did not live that Chriſtian that hated Revenge more than he, or that would forgive an Injury ſooner. Moſt Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, Liberal, Charitable above his Means, for he died in a Debt of 8000 <hi>l.</hi> though his Heir, Sir <hi>Griffith Williams,</hi> had enough in Mannors and Moveables to pay it. He loved to do things Praiſe-worthy. <hi>Nulla eſt tanta humilitas quae dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedine gloriae non capiatur,</hi> Valer. lib. 8. cap. 13.

His Skill in the Tongues, his Skill in the courſe of all Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Arts, in all Hiſtory, in all the parts of Divinity, muſt needs be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: for he had a piercing Wit, a ſound Judgment, a ſtrong Memory, and with all theſe concurred indefatigable Induſtry. Yet by the employment of a great Office, but much more by the Iniquity of troubleſome Suits, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fatal Wars, and moſt of all by the embezelling of his Notes and Papers, Poſterity is little beholding to his Pen; but it owes greatly to his good Works. <hi>Et poſt mortem non opuſcula ſed opera penſanda,</hi> Sidon. lib. ep. 8. ep. 1.
